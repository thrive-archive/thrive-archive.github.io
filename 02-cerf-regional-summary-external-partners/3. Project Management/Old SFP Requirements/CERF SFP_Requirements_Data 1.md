**Regional Plan: Part 1**

The first part of the regional plan presents a baseline of the region. It considers the region’s stakeholders, assesses the factors affecting the region’s economic, environmental, and health conditions, and conducts detailed economic and workforce analyses. The intention is to ensure that the plans take a full account of the factors shaping economic development in the region before developing strategies for recovery and transition.

Conduct the following analyses. In each section, summarize findings and explain how these findings inform the planning process and how they correspond with the Collaborative’s goals.

***1\. Stakeholder Mapping***

A snapshot of the historically active stakeholders that can influence creating a High Road economy in the CERF Region and/or benefit from it.

* Provide the list of organizations and entities and discuss their potential role in developing the plan and engaging in the Implementation Phase. These stakeholders may include but are not limited to employers, businesses, community-based organizations, community members and residents, government and economic development agencies, labor organizations, philanthropic organizations, academic institutions, education and training providers, workforce entities, and industries.

* Overview of the state of disinvested communities in the region. Discuss how and in which areas these communities face economic barriers. Include a snapshot of the plan to outreach to organizations that represent these communities and how the HRTC intends to ensure their active participation.

* Create and show a network of existing partners and their existing regional and subregional plans, strategies, and related reports to demonstrate synergies, potentials, and challenges.

* Clarify opportunities for collaborations and partnerships.

***2\. Regional Summary***

A summary background of the demographic and socio-economic conditions of the region, highlighting areas with low and high economic diversification and resiliency, as well as any industry trends that impact the regional economy. The regional summary must identify regional inequities, such as economic, health, and environmental inequities, currently facing communities in the region.

The regional summary must include the following analysis and discussion: i. Economy and Economic Development 

* Identify economic development opportunities and forces in the region.

* Review inequities in economic development across the region.

* Identify major low- and high- wage industries and occupations in the region.

  • Explore economic well-being and cost of living across the region.

* Economic Shocks: Discuss the impacts caused by economic shocks (e.g., pandemics, natural disasters) or longer-term economic shifts (e.g.., global market signals, automation, policy levers) in the region. These include economic harm to communities (i.e., workers, small businesses, impacted industries, the public sector, and selected regions and populations) as well as the potential for new economic development opportunities.

ii. Climate and Environmental Impact: Identify anticipated climate impacts and the factors that increase the region’s vulnerability to those impacts

* Identify short term and long-term impacts of climate change on the people and economy of the region. These include disproportionate impacts on disinvested communities and expected increases in occupational hazards for workers.

* Identify major sources of air pollution, water pollution, toxic and hazardous waste  
  and their impacts on diverse communities, especially disinvested communities.

* Identify major sources of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions and their impacts on diverse communities, especially disinvested communities.

* Assess impacts of climate change on targeted emerging industries, sectors, or clusters and how these impacts might hinder success of the proposed plans and transition strategies (e.g., damage to critical infrastructure, loss of productivity, loss of population).

iii. Public Health Analysis:

* Provide a snapshot of the impacts of the current economic trends and climate change effects on public health, especially the impacts on disinvested communities.

* Explore the main causes of chronic illnesses and diseases in the region, and whether and how they are related to economic inequalities, climate impacts, environmental factors, etc.

* Analyze health disparities across the region, disaggregated by race, gender, and other demographics.

***3\. Labor Market Analysis***

A snapshot of labor and workforce dynamics in the region, including an overview of major employers, occupations, and wages, the impacts of the recent trends, changes, and forces on the labor market, and projected labor trends in existing key industries. The analysis must also identify the following:

* Industry-specific labor standards that meet high-road priorities.

* Barriers that limit access to high-quality jobs.

* Relevant training programs, apprenticeships, or high road training partnerships in the region.

***4\. Industry Cluster Analysis:***

A snapshot of current major industries as well as industry trends and projections. The analysis must also:

* Include an in-depth analysis of potential growth clusters based on the region’s comparative advantages, market trends, workforce, infrastructure assets, policy trends, aligned state/federal investments, supply chain, and innovation ecosystem.

* Identify major sources of GHG emissions, air and water pollution, and toxic or hazardous waste from existing or proposed clusters.

* Conduct measurements of potential for job growth within industries.

* Identify workers and sectors at risk of displacement due to identified trends and analyses.

***5\. SWOT Analysis***

An in-depth analysis of regional Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats (i.e., SWOT), especially as it relates to equitable economic resilience and growth of sustainable industry clusters. The SWOT analysis will draw from data and components through conducting the above analyses.

**Regional Plan: Part 2**

HRTCs will also be required to develop a holistic economic development and transition roadmap with strategies that prioritize the creation of high-quality jobs, equitable access to jobs and resources, and emphasizes developing sustainable and resilient economies and industries. These industries include but are not limited to renewable energy, energy efficiency, carbon removal, zero-emission vehicles, advanced manufacturing, agriculture, forestry, artificial intelligence, and climate restoration and resilience. The roadmap and strategies must refer to the findings of the analyses in Part 1\. The roadmap must include:

1. ***Vision and Goals***

Develop a vision and specific regional goals for creating a High Road economy that is sustainable, inclusive, and equitable.

2. ***Strategies for the growth of targeted industries:***

i.Industrial Cluster Development: This section will provide a snapshot of current trends

and projected growth. It will consider, but is not bound by, existing relevant plans such as CEDS (if applicable and appropriate) along with the following elements that work together to support creation of quality jobs:

* Clear Local Market Signals: Assess how proposed industries and affiliated  
  investments align with market trends and local/state/federal policies.
