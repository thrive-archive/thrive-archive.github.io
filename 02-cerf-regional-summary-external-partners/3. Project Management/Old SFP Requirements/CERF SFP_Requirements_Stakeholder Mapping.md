**Regional Plan: Part 1**

The first part of the regional plan presents a baseline of the region. It considers the region’s stakeholders, assesses the factors affecting the region’s economic, environmental, and health conditions, and conducts detailed economic and workforce analyses. The intention is to ensure that the plans take a full account of the factors shaping economic development in the region before developing strategies for recovery and transition.

Conduct the following analyses. In each section, summarize findings and explain how these findings inform the planning process and how they correspond with the Collaborative’s goals.
