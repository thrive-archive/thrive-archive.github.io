# Coachella/Morongo Basin SRT Meeting Summary

March 29, 2024

## **OVERVIEW:**

The Coachella/Morongo Basin SRT Meeting on March 29th consisted of 6 attendees and 3 SRT leads. The attendees came from various locations including Coachella, Riverside, Beaumont, Spring Valley, Palm Springs, Anaheim, San Bernardino, and Yucca Valley. Both attendees and SRT leads represented different affinity groups; 2 from labor, 2 elected officials, 1 non-profit, and 4 business owners. Approximately 6 Community Insights Surveys were completed and it was requested that SRT send out surveys to email with the new due date. It was recommended for the next meeting or via email to identify specific orgs, programs, or collaborations in the region. This summary describes themes identified in meeting notes/a transcript of the meeting recording.

## **DISCUSSION:**

The meeting participants discussed case study and solutions-oriented with ideas around best practices. Primarily covering Transportation, Career Pathways, Skills Building, Housing, and Industries.

## **THEMES:**

5 major themes emerged from this meeting. For 4 of them \- Transportation, Career Pathways, Housing, and Skills Building \- both barriers and solutions were presented related to these topics. The Industries theme was presented as opportunities for training and development within the following key industries: Energy, GIS Technology, Robotics, Energy Efficient Vehicles, and Construction.

### **Transportation**

A few key barriers emerged for this theme including a lack of a reliable public transportation system, the feasibility of energy efficient vehicles, and traffic. The mentions for public transportation highlight insufficient transit, especially in the evening hours. Energy efficient vehicles like EVs and Hydrogen also present a range of issues including their affordability, “EVs \[are\] too expensive all around,” and insufficient infrastructure causing “range anxiety” among their users as there are limited charging locations: “Stations don’t work and take too long to be repaired.” Issues related to traffic mention delays due to 62 highway being the primary access road.

The solutions proposed for the Transportation theme include the need to “wrap jobs and services around transit”, expanding mass transit systems like “more bus and train lines and high speed rail from Redlands, through Beaumont, to the desert”, increasing infrastructure for energy efficient vehicles like “EV charging stations and training”, and innovating to improve traffic management like “building a logistics corridor”, “developing transit agency for desert transportation infrastructure”, increasing the number of “self-driving vehicles”, and creating a platform to “harness data to move traffic more efficiently” as per the “Michael Lim case study.”

The solution to building transit-oriented communities to wrap jobs around mass transit also mentions a focus on designing communities “around train stops for Bright Line” and other lines and creates a “smooth transportation shift from train to next mode” especially for disabled people. Other concerns include the future Coachella Valley rail line that “has been approved but is 20 years out” and “currently determining the stops; Bright Line from Las Vegas to Rancho Cucamonga” and the need to collaborate “with SCAG, transit agencies, cities, and community to plan for transit stops in order to improve “experiences at train stops”. The mention also includes a focus on advocating for a publicity campaign to educate the general public about train culture and the benefit of being able to integrate “nature, food, culture, pleasure trips, child care, grocery stores, afterschool programs, training program, arts, community/social  hubs around train stops”, taking into account the “Singapore model”. Another mention that merges two themes; Transportation and Housing, highlights the importance of “reducing low density, single family housing” in favor of “higher density housing near transit”. The case study referenced is “Cul-de-sac Tempe, AZ \- pre-fab buildings”.  This shows the need for urban planning to strategically integrate transportation, housing, and employment hubs for improving quality of life in communities.

### **Career Pathways**

Several barriers emerge for this theme including the gap between the skills acquired through education and industry demands, lack of STEM education in early schooling, challenges of parents in supporting their children with school assignments, as “Parents don’t have access or training to teach tech”, inadequate pathways to place skilled workers into jobs, for example, “200 semi-trained in cybersecurity on waiting list but no jobs available, reveals there is limited mentoring opportunities to help transition graduates into the workforce. One of the most prevalent concerns revolves around “schools not preparing workforce with adequate skills”, and sometimes there is a disconnect between skills learned in “schools and real world use”. In the technology sector, college graduates lack the training needed for their jobs, revealing a need for in-job training, some examples include, “coders out of school can’t code until the employer pays to train for 6 months”, and “college-trained employee took 8 months for employer to train in project management”.

The solutions proposed for the Career Pathways theme include innovation in education practices, expanding apprenticeships, mentorship programs, and “Third spaces”, as well as developing models for “private/public partnerships'' in which “government can support but should not lead”. When it comes to innovating education practices there is a need for “smaller satellite trade schools” and “project-based learning schools”, and a balance between theory and “experiential learning” so students get “real world training”. For example, “Don’t teach HTML in Computer Science; teach for innovation”. There was a mention for apprenticeships to allow “students to work on site with tech and business” to “make clear connections between learning and jobs through project work”. For example, “Cybersecurity businesses ‘don’t care’ about education but want to see 203 great projects”, emphasizing the need for candidates to have ample practical experience rather than degrees or certificates in order to find a job. It was also mentioned the need to “develop networks to create projects” and a “centralized hub of info, networks, and resource for the region”. For mentorship programs the focus was on “starting in elementary school and within the school system”, emphasizing the importance for mentors to “look like community, especially in BIPOC communities” as this would create trust and better “encourage youth to transform lives”. For “Third space”, it was mentioned to create “co-work space and shared spaces, and incubator spaces/hubs” to “banish loneliness, catalyze networks and innovation” and support the community with “social entrepreneurship” as per the “Municipalized We Work” case study.

### **Housing**

Two barriers emerged for this theme including insufficient low income housing stock, and low housing density near transit systems. The solutions proposed were an increase of workforce housing, a reduction of low density housing, and a change in policy recommending “30% public housing”. Although these barriers fall within the housing theme, it is evident that this problem is related to transportation access in the region; having limited housing options near their places of work, workers have challenging commutes.

### **Skills Building**

For this theme, the barriers that emerged were inefficient communication among workers and employers reflecting the observation that “Regionally people are ‘working in silos’, there is competition and a scarcity mindset”, and a lack of training and apprenticeship programs for disinvested communities especially for women who “need trades support”,  and for folks in the desert area as it is too far and there is “insufficient access to training”.

The solutions proposed for the Skills Building theme mention the “need for satellite training hubs”, “small business and entrepreneurship” that “support community building, equity, and social entrepreneurship and fosters creativity and grit. It is also proposed to “develop and build on trades ‘sisterhood’ for women”, and “leadership and DEI training for kids” with a focus on “culture, innovation, teaching resilience, learning to adapt” as seen in the “One OC” case study. There is a mention for “DEI to mean finding diverse groups of youth/diamonds in the rough early on and offering opportunities”. Some questions that were asked to foster this conversation are:

* How can we build on diverse backgrounds/diverse experiences?

* What dream, future jobs can we expose diverse youth to early on to create access?

Another mention said “electrical trades training and structure is an apprenticement model for management” and expects to include “skills building, apprenticeships, on the job training, and mentorship” to “close knowledge gaps”. Some examples include:

* Electrical trades mentorship and skills building is built into the network structure

* Case study: Pilot program: High school after-school pre-apprenticeship program

Another solution proposed community-centric programs to “build trust, wrap workers in mentoring, apprenticeships, and self-sustaining models that support workers through retirement” and provide “network building and community building” as those were identified as keys to a “successful model”.

### **Industries**

The energy sector needs “proactive planning and public transit infrastructure for the lithium industry.” There's also a need for energy-efficient jobs and training a skilled labor market for a transition to hydrogen energy. Education on green energy is essential, emphasizing diverse solutions like gantry lines and hydrogen. In GIS technology, there's a “need for improved geospatial awareness” and user-friendly training in this technology. Robotics demand a shift from fear about “robots taking jobs” to education for humans to “program, maintain, and run” robots, focusing on innovation and making repetitive labor more efficient. For the Energy Efficient Vehicles industry, there is opportunity in “manufacturing and training”. In construction, training in “prefab manufacturing” and “green building” are mentioned as possible opportunities for this sector, alongside building “workforce housing” and “high density housing and transit hubs with incubators and satellite training hubs”. Once again, there is a call for strategic integration of housing and transit hubs with centers for training and/or employment.
