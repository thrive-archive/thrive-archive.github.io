When asked which barriers and solutions have the most impact, the following recurring themes were mentioned most often:

**Education and Training**

* **Barriers**

  Panel members cited barriers such as:  
* a lack of additional education and training resources that are easily identified by community members seeking them out

* being in debt from attending college with no knowledge of programs that could help with scholarships or free college  
* lack of support to assist with things like taxes and FASFA submission.  
    
* **Solutions**

  Solutions included a central location for education and training resources and more community outreach to make the community aware that the programs exist, free college tuition and scholarships and mentors who could provide assistance with how to navigate aforementioned systems and support when filling out forms as well as referrals to better career pathway support during and after college to assist with finding a good job. 

  Organizations mentioned that provided assistance included AmeriCorps and Conservation Corps.

**Building Social and Cultural Capital**

* **Barriers**

  Panelists cited barriers such as lack of feeling of belonging and feelings of loneliness and isolation, which contributed to an inability to build and navigate relationships needed to create a support network. Other barriers were a lack of feeling that there was someone they could rely on for help and feelings that there was no one who could help them “figure out life”. Further comments included personal trust violations that led to lack of building relationships, lack of stability in their home life, and lack of mentors to help show them what “normal people do”. One panelist stated “Youth don't know what to hope for if they've never seen it”

* **Solutions**

  Solutions mentioned were more support programs for those in training and education programs including more programs for career pathways with knowledgeable educators who have familiarity of community issues and how to navigate systems that support career pathway programs.
