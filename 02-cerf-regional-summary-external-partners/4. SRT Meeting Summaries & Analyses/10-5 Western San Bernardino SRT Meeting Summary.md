# Western San Bernardino SRT Meeting Summary

October 5, 2023

The purpose of this meeting was multi-faceted, focusing primarily on updates, engagement, and planning for future initiatives related to community development, equity, accessibility, and outreach. Overall, the meeting aimed to foster a collaborative environment for discussing and advancing equity, accessibility, and community development through various initiatives and events, while also enhancing engagement and collecting valuable data from the community. The meeting responses were broken down into the following sectors: the business sector, the educational sector, the community-based organizations sector, and the community member sectors. This summary is based on a set of meeting notes that consolidated all feedback across all sectors. While it was not possible to determine the number of groups or individuals that noted a particular theme, it was possible to describe the number of times a particular theme was mentioned by all participants. The following questions were used to gather these data:

## Discussion Questions

A. 	What projects or initiatives is your organization currently involved in to support/that are aligned with community economic resilience efforts?

B. 	What are the challenges and gaps that you have been facing to have a thriving life in the West End?

C.  	What are opportunities for further collaboration or partnerships that you see with other groups/stakeholders present in the room today (Government, Education, CBOs, Businesses, Community)?

D. 	Have you had opportunities to contribute your perspectives in the past, and how would you prefer to engage and contribute in the future?

E.  	Can you share examples of how your organization actively seeks input and feedback from all segments of the community, including those historically marginalized?

## Summary of Key Themes:

The focal point of the discussion was primarily centered on addressing the challenges and gaps identified within the community, as delineated in question B. These challenges encompass a broad spectrum of barriers, including those related to accommodation/housing, financial and resource constraints, access to education, employment opportunities, as well as obstacles in forging effective partnerships.

A significant theme that emerged during the discussion was the identification of barriers and opportunities for securing quality employment. Notable opportunities within this domain include the availability of training and professional development, particularly within the manufacturing sector, and the enhancement of soft skills among the youth. Additionally, the concept of family-oriented employment opportunities was discussed, emphasizing the importance of flexible working hours and childcare provisions.

The discussion also highlighted the critical need for adequate resources targeted at youth empowerment, encompassing training, internships, apprenticeships, and soft skills development. Other key sectors identified for their potential contributions include Chambers of Commerce, educational institutions, community-based and local nonprofit organizations, the manufacturing sector, government entities, and the broader business community.

The table provided below summarizes the key themes identified during the discussion, alongside their definitions based on the meeting survey and their frequency of mention across the survey responses.

## Potential Additional Questions for Exploration Based on Group Responses

1.) Can SRT members and community members define more specifically what kinds of training and professional development would be helpful within the manufacturing sector (or other sectors)? Can we push a little deeper to understand what they have been told is holding them back from advancing in those sectors?

2.) What strategies can be implemented to enhance soft skills among the youth, and how can these strategies be integrated into existing education and training programs?
