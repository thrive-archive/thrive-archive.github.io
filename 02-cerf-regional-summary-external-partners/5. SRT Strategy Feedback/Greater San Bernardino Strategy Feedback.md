**Greater SB SRT Meeting and Reviewer Group Notes**  
May 13 and \~May 24, 2024

## **OVERVIEW:**

The Greater SB Strategy Review Meeting on May 13th consisted of 5 attendees and 2 SRT leads and support teams, and 3 reviewers responded on the Google notes form. The attendees came from various locations, including Redlands, Colton, San Bernardino, Corona, and outside the IE. Reviewers represented different affinity groups: education, CBOs, labor, workforce, youth, residents, and the disinvested community. Reviewers began with a discussion of the structure and presentation of strategies, strategic development overall, and notes regarding the regional plan. Reviewer meeting attendees self-selected strategies and topics to discuss, and additional reviewers used the google form through May 24, 2024\. This report serves to summarize their valuable feedback on Thrive Inland Socal draft strategy summaries. 


## **KEY TAKEAWAYS:**

* **Advanced manufacturing** \- Leverage significant STEM initiatives and IE Strong Workforce manufacturing projects that already exist across the Inland region. Higher-margin products are the key. Strategy development should begin with research into unmet needs for high-margin products; talk to potential customers in the region and further away. The stated questions can probably be answered pretty quickly using GIS. Take a deeper look at these potential small to large size corporations; investigate if they have any unfair labor practice charges against them as well as the nature of their relationship to the community. "Advanced manufacturing" is a technical category – What kinds of products fit that description? Advanced chip manufacturing technology needed. Our goal should be to become a national leader in training, and transition from product-based to tech manufacturing. See more in “raw notes.”   
  * Questions to be explored: How might we support entrepreneurism in this sector? What is the extent of small businesses in this sector? Are there risks associated with community members working in chemicals, building components, and construction materials manufacturing? For example, would the chemicals cause increased cancer risk over time to those who work there or those who live around the processing areas? Eventually, would these jobs be automated in the future? Does "infrastructure investments, efforts to improve the business climate" imply giving money to corporations to make improvements they are not willing to pay for? How can we work with the federal government for funding through CHIPS Act funding and build tech infrastructure?  
* **Business services** \- Odd to lump cybersecurity with the creative economy. Thank you for including the creative economy, graphic design and music production; add more creative sector jobs in the entertainment industry. Recommend that instead of creating another industry-led employer alliance, that the region leverage and build upon the resources of CSUSB and its established networks both in and beyond the region. RCC has AA degrees in cybersecurity. Approach to strategy development needs to prioritize customer discovery. Before starting a cybersecurity accelerator, we need to determine the extent of the unmet need. Include nonprofits under the umbrella of “businesses,” and invest fully in infrastructure and capacity of nonprofits. See also “raw notes.”  
  * Questions to be explored: How to ensure cyber jobs stay in the regions and do not become remote jobs? How do we make sure that these cybersecurity programs don't focus on surveillance technology used to oppress the community? We need open-ended questions for small and medium sized businesses.  
* **Cleantech** \- Efforts need to be intentionally connected to the advanced manufacturing efforts. This is the strategy we should lead with while prioritizing historically disinvested communities. Community engagement and education around cleantech opportunities needed. Need to model what green transition/clean energy car manufacturing will look like in the region. One on one conversations with potential customers are needed; we need data on economic buyers first and where the demand is strongest.  Along with this strategy, integrate a resource and info hub. See also “raw notes.”  
  * Questions to be explored: Which aspects of cleantech have the highest customer demand in the region or nearby? How do we connect cleantech to other job opportunities like local government or the water district so that we ensure people from the community are later encouraged to stay in the community?  
* **Sustainable supply chains** \- Build on existing efforts in the region. Focus on the charging infrastructure, renewable energy generation, and ZEV maintenance/charging. The consortium should include environmental groups as well. Additional research needed on what customers want. Check which companies would participate. Community solar projects that benefit historically disinvested households.   
  * Questions to be explored: Why aren't we shifting the focus to the communities for this and giving them priority? Why do logistics, institutions, and warehousing seem to benefit the most from these proposals? Who is taking on the cost of adding solar panels to warehouses? What is the cost to add solar panels to one private warehouse vs a neighborhood? What is the plan to ensure equity?  
* **Access to childcare** \- First Five, CSUSB, and Child Resource Center work with QSSB should be tapped to address this section. Help people start child care businesses to meet local demand, and focus on supporting women entrepreneurs of color. Focus on offering financial assistance and wraparound services such as childcare, mental health support, transportation, technology access, and legal assistance. Focus on learning more about parents’ needs, and engage nonprofits in child advocacy.   
  * Question to be explored: How is childcare being defined for this process?  
* **Access to the education and training needed for quality jobs** \- Develop short certificate programs linked specifically to high road job qualifications. Make these trainings a focus and accessible in places such as the library in our region.
* **Building cultural and social capital** \- Identify funding streams to pay mentors. Change language around “culture” for clarity. This is what ERC in San Bernardino is doing. If others are doing this, we should duplicate efforts. Supportive networks and affinity groups that provide peer mentorship and encouragement that are localized and help keep talent in the region is needed. Effective collaboration requires investing value into what is best for the community, but building social capital must be done through management and training to establish trust. We need community benefits agreements for new industries as well as communities of practice. We need training in supporting the community in times of economic instability, to prevent neglect of the region, to learn how to be middle class, and adapt when things go awry. See more in “raw notes.” 
* **Employer-supported workforce housing \-** Build on SB Playbook. Focus on building permanently affordable housing, co-ops, or land trusts? 
  * Question to be explored: What happens to employee housing if employees lose their job? 
* **Entrepreneurial ecosystem for high-growth startups and  Main Street businesses** \- Invest in incubators to determine what is needed. Without data on demand, many people will propose commodity based businesses that compete only on price rather than on high value added products and services. Develop paid entrepreneurial programs. Train child care owners to run businesses. Train mainstream business/high growth market workers to understand where unmet needs are in communities. Expand business mentoring programs, and train business owners to mentor. Include in discussion of entrepreneurship capacity, infrastructure, and how to leverage economic drivers. See more in “raw notes.”   
  * Questions to be explored: How can we ensure that this is community-focused and equitable? Who would run a program like this, is it an institution or a community organization?  
  * Provide a barriers list:

    * Immigration status 

    * Employed 7 days a week but still not making ends meet 

    * No inherited wealth due to historic structural racism such as red lining. 

    * No time to acquire skills to create high value added goods and services. 

    * English language learner 

    * Transportation barriers 

    * May have hidden strengths not apparent because of visible disabilities

* **Pathways to careers in management** \-  This strategy needs development. We need management 2.0 to build a diverse, thriving coaching and mentoring ecosystem. We need funding for management training in sector-based nonprofit management training and apprenticeships as well as funding for nonprofit management training. 

  * Questions to be explored: Who is looking to fill management positions? Management in what industry? Are we advocating for leadership academies outside of the workplace? Or is this more of an internal goal for each company in the region? Generally, there is a lack of upward mobility in some sectors or specific employers but this point doesn't clarify what we are looking for.

* **Pathways to quality jobs in construction and related trades** \- Add programs for formerly incarcerated and strong pre-apprenticeship programs starting in middle school.

* **Pathways to quality jobs in healthcare** \- Connect people getting certifications to training in entrepreneurship, a centralized resources hub, and identified service demand areas. Listen to unions of healthcare workers. Address the physician desert and loss of trained workers to other regions.

* **Pathways to quality jobs in IT** \- Connect people getting certifications with entrepreneurship training. Identify unmet demand and conduct service needs research. Ensure that this program is equity based and focuses on the local community. What are some of the higher level needs for IT workers? Include universities in this training work, and offer satellite services at local libraries.

* **Technology access** \- Link this strategy to IT. Invest in infrastructure improvements to expand broadband access to underserved areas.

* **Transportation access** \- Generally this is a good start. Since residents travel outside the region, perhaps we should shift our focus to advocating for a faster, more frequent train system.


## **GENERAL TAKEAWAYS**

* Work to invest in future endeavors, not current. Look at emerging markets, and plan for 5-10 years. We need gaps analysis. 

* Need SWOT analysis for each industry with data and graphics to easily identify what ideas are valuable and viable.   
* Relay strategies with info, graphics, data, combined all together.   
* Relay how wealth building strategies interact with the four tradable sectors.  
* Look at customer demand and unmet needs to establish a baseline.  
* Move away from a siloed list and apply systems-oriented strategies.  
* Audit all potential funding mechanisms.  
* Ensure that all investment and efforts prioritize keeping talent and money in the region.




**GSB SRT Strategy Review Meeting and Google Form Raw Notes** 

The following are the raw notes of the in-meeting conversation around strategy review summaries as well as notes from the Google form. Three (3) reviewers submitted notes to the [Google form](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19jt0g0ASY1DOxNvSKXqXla4B5KXLZxWYlm59XZRbCq0/edit?usp=sharing).

**Review notes on the structure and presentation of strategies, strategic development overall, and notes regarding the regional plan**

* Section titles need verbs  
* Start with strengths and weaknesses  
* What are we designing for? Need clear statement of assets being built upon  
* What solutions are we gearing toward?  
* For data team: reformulate reports into how they affect four sectors and economic mobility/wealth-building  
* Too much text to sift through, not easily readable  
* Strategy summaries are not an arrangement that is readable  
* Add graphics, add data related to points being made

* Encourage collaboration for initiatives, instead of asking participants to focus on themselves  
  * View initiatives through one central lens/framework  
* Matrix with four industry clusters and how economic mobility and wealth-building applies to each of the clusters  
* This is a siloed list: Need system, not independent factors

* Need to expand understanding of baselines, services, etc.  
* Customer research: Who wants each of these pieces of infrastructure, where are the customers?  
* Logic model to build up resources  
* Look at region systemically to make sure money is going to the right places (unmet needs)  
* Focus on how infrastructures are similar, not how they are different  
* Find sources of funding, mentor people to get funding successfully and consistently  
* Identify additional funding sources (federal, state, philanthropic, etc.)  
* Reduce competition for funding within the region  
* Help people learn the skills to create new industries/companies, not just supporting existing ones  
* Reasons to fix weaknesses  
* Need more motivation to pursue areas of strength  
* Pursue initiatives that can benefit all four industries  
* Match strengths to existing infrastructures instead of building from scratch  
* Work to invest in future endeavors, not just what makes money at the current moment  
  * We get caught up in economic multipliers but need gaps analysis  
  * Look at emerging markets  
  * Plan for 5-10 years  
  * Opportunity costs: investing now vs. later. What are the costs of not investing right now?  
  * How to invest in a way that brings down cost and increases opportunity  
  * We need infrastructure. The cost for investing remains high.  
* We need to focus on implementation  
* Ensure that investment, workers, money stays here.  
* Address gaps in educational programs for specific topics  
* How to restart prosperity in low-income communities  
* Does money spent in our region benefit local people or conglomerates instead?  
* Does money leave the region or is it reinvested into the community?  
* Harmful potential for AI to get rid of a lot of jobs  
* Develop tradable sectors individually with foundation of services around it: transportation, housing, childcare  
* Concerns about time frame: these ideas are relevant, but can we accomplish them by June?


  
**PRIORITY TRADABLE INDUSTRY CLUSTERS**

**Advanced manufacturing**

* Significant STEM initiatives already exist across the IE; sample of some of them:  [https://www.wsbcss.org/apps/pages/index.jsp?uREC\_ID=2353354\&type=d\&pREC\_ID=2218321](https://www.wsbcss.org/apps/pages/index.jsp?uREC_ID=2353354&type=d&pREC_ID=2218321)   [https://www.rcoe.us/departments/educational-services/instructional-services/content-and-pedagogy-support/content-areas/science-technology-engineering-mathematics-stem/step-programs](https://www.rcoe.us/departments/educational-services/instructional-services/content-and-pedagogy-support/content-areas/science-technology-engineering-mathematics-stem/step-programs)  Both County Offices of Education support these efforts    
* Significant K12 Strong Workforce manufacturing projects across the IE:  [https://desertcolleges.org/strong-workforce/k12/\#tab-15995](https://desertcolleges.org/strong-workforce/k12/#tab-15995)     
* Question to be explored: How might we support entrepreneurism in this sector? What is the extend of small businesses in this sector?    
* Technical Employment Training program: [http://technicalemploy.org](http://technicalemploy.org)     
* To identify existing K12 and CC programs across the IE: [https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/c36da81abafc4492b5df2caa07bd76dc/%20](https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/c36da81abafc4492b5df2caa07bd76dc/%20)   
* I agree with item 1\. Higher-margin products are the key. Strategy development has to begin with research into unmet needs for high-margin products. Otherwise, we have no reason to direct resources toward building advanced manufacturing capacity. Interviews with manufacturers are not enough. Need to talk to their potential customers in region and further away. Catalyst funding could train and pay business owners or startup founders to do this research and build their capacity for customer discovery. The initial ideas are too heavily focused on commercialization without research on demand. Invention without a market is not innovation. Innovation can only occur when someone values the invention. Needs collaboration between business, tech, and innovation educators. Too many businesses and university think tanks waste resources on prototypes for products no one wants.  Creating awareness of STEM careers is important. We also need to build resilience as a skill so that students will not give up when they face hard tasks. The stated questions can probably be answered pretty quickly using GIS.   The questions I am asking cannot. They require on the ground, in person interviews with potential customers for advanced manufacturing products. Where do they get these products now? What do they like and dislike about current solutions? Where do they go for information about solutions?  With a strong sense of customer needs, we can design an eco-system best geared to meet them. "Advanced manufacturing" is a technical category. What kinds of products fit that description?  
* Are there risks associated to community members working in the chemicals, building components, and construction materials manufacturing? For example, would the chemicals cause increased cancer risk over time to those who work there or those who live around the processing areas? Eventually, would these jobs be automated in the future? Does "infrastructure investments, efforts to improve the business climate" imply giving money to corporations to make improvements they are not willing to pay for? We should take a deeper look at these potential small to large size corporations and investigate if they have any unfair labor practice charges against them and what is the nature of their relationship to the community is. I do not know people currently employed in any of these areas of manufacturing, but focus groups should be prioritized to get their feedback.  
* We have a robust logistics infrastructure in the region: how to leverage this infrastructure?  
* Advanced chip manufacturing technology needed. Our goal should be to become national leader in training  
  * Transition from product-based to tech manufacturing  
  * How can we work with the federal government for funding? CHIPS Act funding and tech infrastructure

**Business services**

* Seems odd to lump Cyber with the creative economy; very different labor market demand and very different career ladders/income potential.   
* Recommend that instead of creating another industry-led employer alliance, that the region leverage and build upon the resources of CSUSB and its established networks both in and beyond the IE.   
* To identify existing K12 and CC programs across the IE: [https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/c36da81abafc4492b5df2caa07bd76dc/%20](https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/c36da81abafc4492b5df2caa07bd76dc/%20)   
* Intro:  RCC now has AA degrees in cyber security.  
* Approach to strategy development.  Not very interesting.    
* As with previous sector, ignores the importance of customer discovery. Who is looking for these services?  Who needs them but is not looking because they do not realize the cyber security threat?  How much could they afford to pay?  Even though generic data says demand should exist, we need local information about who is actually in need.   It is highly possible that small businesses have a greater perceived need for legal, financial, or accounting services. Only once these needs are met will they be ready to address cyber security in their businesses.  We need data to confirm this assumption.      
* Initial Ideas:  
  * Before starting a cyber security accelerator, we need to determine the extent of the unmet need. Is this the top priority for small businesses in the region? We should consider paying students to do this research. We should home grow these service providers.  
  * If cyber security is not the top concern of our small businesses, we should develop capacity for the services the DO need.  
* Questions to be explored  
  * We already know that most of our company eco-system is small and medium sized businesses. We also know that the region lost thousands of them during COVID.  CSUSB conducted some research on the small business climate.  We need specifics on what they need through open ended questions not surveys or focus groups to sway their answers.  
* How is freight arrangement a part of sustainable supply chains? Thank you for including the creative economy, graphic design and music production. This echoes what folks were saying at the IPC, but this messaging should be pushed to the top as well. I believe there is also an opportunity here to loop in more creative sector jobs possible stage/set design given the growing entertainment industry in the IE. It would be great to get the advice of ArtsConnection and see what other industries make sense. This could also be a way to loop in industry unions (IATSE etc). How do we make sure that these cybersecurity programs don't focus on surveillance technology used to oppress the community? How do we make sure that these jobs stay in the IE and are not remote jobs open to other areas? Again, it would be important to check which companies would participate, do they have ULP charges and unions? Are there other industries we can collaborate with for cyber security (this seems very logistics and manufacturing focused, especially for cybersecurity where there could be other industry focuses universities, non-profits, culture..)  
* Inclusion of nonprofits under the umbrella of “businesses”  
  * Invest in infrastructure of nonprofits  
    * Bring in outside funding sources  
    * Workforce should stay in communities it originates in  
    * Money is not staying in the region from outside nonprofits  
    * How to move into building diverse management in the nonprofit sector  
    * Coaching and mentorship not common in the region due to lack of funds for entire sector  
    * Nonprofits need to address the effects of industries drying up in the region  
* Cyberpreneurship exists at RCC  
* Downtown SB could be model for other areas  
* How do we keep people here once trained?


**Cleantech**

* These efforts need to be intentionally attached/connected to the Advanced Manufacturing efforts.  
* People do not know what Clean Tech is, how it's used, and what economic opportunities exist for a relatively "new" industry for this region (beyond solar and wind energy farms, etc.); can this be narrowed down to understandable and attainable goals that community can get excited about and take advantage of?  
* To identify existing K12 and CC programs across the IE: [https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/c36da81abafc4492b5df2caa07bd76dc/%20](https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/c36da81abafc4492b5df2caa07bd76dc/%20)   
* "Good intro.  My impression is that the CERT and OASIS programs are more faculty serving that customer serving. This is a major weakness.  
* Approach to strategy development:  
  * One on one conversations are essential, but more important to have them with potential customers. What are their needs?  Do they care about being more sustainable?  If not, what do they care about.  See note above.  
* Initial ideas.  
  * No to the first 3\.  These centers already have a lot of funding.  Research facilities in the region are not customer focused, they are tech solutions looking for a problem.  We need data on economic buyers first.  Who feels a pain that clean tech can solve?  Start with the societal need. Yes on items 4, 5, and 6, but only after we know where the demand is strongest.  Otherwise, we will be funding the wrong solutions.    
* Questions to be explored:  
  * Focus on demand not just on supply. Which aspects of clean tech have the highest customer demand in the region or nearby?  No need t   
* This is the strategy we should lead with. Highlighting the point of prioritizing historically disinvested communities could get community members interested in and support the work. At the same time, I feel that building out a plan that outlines how members could be informed of these jobs, (via OASIS or other job center) could be helpful. I'm struggling to see how supporting the construction and development of the OASIS Clean Tech Park is equitable for the community. I understand that UCR is one of the main institutions in the area but shouldn't they have found other sources for funding as well? There's a balance between subsiding these institutions and making sure this funding goes directly to the community. For example, People's Collective for Environmental Justice has worked on getting kids into water sampling. How do we connect cleantech to other job opportunities like local government or the water district so that we ensure people from the community are later encouraged to stay in the community?  
* Clean energy, car manufacturers: What does clean energy look like in the region? How to invest in it?  
* Energy rates are increasing in the region: problematic for low-income population  
* Steps to get to clean energy (affordability, access) in the region  
* What does the transition look like? What does a green infrastructure look like?

**Sustainable supply chains**

* CSUSB Leonard Transportation Center: [https://www.csusb.edu/leonard-transportation-center](https://www.csusb.edu/leonard-transportation-center)  
* CSUSB has been doing work around this sector for quite a few years; efforts have slowed dramatically since the pandemic, but much of what they had could probably still be leveraged  
* Baldy View ROP Logistics program:  [https://www.baldyviewrop.com/high-school-students/course-videos](https://www.baldyviewrop.com/high-school-students/course-videos)  [https://resources.finalsite.net/images/v1693251536/baldyviewropcom/dcu7aivrsdsbz0vif4dc/tdlf21.pdf](https://resources.finalsite.net/images/v1693251536/baldyviewropcom/dcu7aivrsdsbz0vif4dc/tdlf21.pdf)     
* To identify existing K12 and CC programs across the IE: [https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/c36da81abafc4492b5df2caa07bd76dc/%20](https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/c36da81abafc4492b5df2caa07bd76dc/%20)   
* Intro: Good   
* Approach to strategy development:    
  * Assumes that potential customers WANT or care about sustainable supply chains. What if they do not? What do they care about most? Probably compliance with new regulations? They might be worried about community protests more than sustainability.  
* Initial ideas   
  * I like the last two ideas, but they need research to validate assumptions   
* Questions to be explored   
  * The first Q assumes that these centers have done customer discovery and are solving actual problems. Need to check that assumption.   
  * The third Q assumes that sufficient demand exists to justify increased investment in workforce development. Needs to be tested. Do any business owners care?  
* Focusing on the charging infrastructure, renewable energy generation, and ZEV maintenance/charging is the best bet to get the community to back this. Even the first sentence of this gives some benefit of the doubt to the logistic industry, as other IPC members mentioned- it's about framing. The consortium should include environmental groups as well. I recommend asking folks like Plug in IE to join as well. (On a general note, it seems like a lot of these strategies are tied to: logistics, manufacturing and entrepreneurship. Why aren't we also thinking of stable local jobs as well? Government jobs are usually unionized and we know that there's a vacancy in these positions.) Again, it would be important to check which companies would participate, do they have ULP charges and unions? On the point of "Increase solar panel installation on warehouse roofs and expand community solar projects that benefit historically disinvested households." Why aren't we shifting the focus to the communities for this and give them priority? Why do logistics, institutions, and warehousing seem to benefit the most from these proposals? Who is taking on the cost of adding solar panels to warehouses? What is the cost to add solar panels to one private warehouse vs a neighborhood? What is the plan to ensure equity?


**ECONOMIC MOBILITY & WEALTH BUILDING**

**Access to childcare**

* First Five, CSUSB, and Child Resource Center work with QSSB (Quality Start San BErnardino) should be tapped to address this section; James Moses can speak directly to a number of past and present initiatives occurring throughout the region and their level of success.  
* Initial ideas: Add "Help people start child care businesses to meet local demand."  
* This point "Offer financial assistance and wraparound services such as childcare, mental health support, transportation, technology access, and legal assistance to lower barriers to participation in training and education programs." should be the focus. Because the other points just sound like we are giving this money back to institutions so that they can expand more than they already are. We should focus on creating quality child care and what parents need. This point doesn't go in depth to what the actual needs from parents are. A while ago, UCR had family housing that was right next to the child development building where parent students could drop off their child and head to classes. What did UCR do to that program? They demolished the affordable parent housing and moved parents to Falkirk. This only caused a squeeze to the on campus apartments. So why not expand the Center for Early Childhood Education specifically?  
* How is childcare being defined for this process?  
* Preschool owners, family childcare owners are often women of color, and many women preschool and childcare business owner have gone out of business due to changes in early childhood education. Need more representation in that sector. Concern around wages for Black and Brown women (not being paid a living wage). See also in entrepreneurship.  
* Engage nonprofits in child advocacy

**Access to the education and training needed for quality jobs**

* Initial ideas: Add "Develop short certificate programs linked specifically to high road job qualifications.  
* We should also make this point a focus. It could be beneficial to add these trainings in easy to access places such as the library. In Durham, North Carolina the county library offers these services to small businesses and they have seen success. Plus the library is a less intimidating space for folks to come and get these trainings. It could even have child care on site. We should expand more on this point.

**Building cultural and social capital**

* Initial ideas. Add "Pay people for training and serving as mentors."  
* This just sounds like what the ERC in San Bernardino wants to do. The point is a little misleading because it sounds like it might focus on culture like music and arts. Again, all this can be absorbed to the local library with support. We need to look at who is already doing this work, and if there really is a need to do double work. Supportive networks and affinity groups that provide peer mentorship and encouragement that are localized and help keep talent in the IE is needed.  
* Investment in a new industry: needs good paying jobs, philanthropy, support of community  
* Effective collaboration requires investing value into what is best for the community  
* Social capital and connection  
  * Building social capital must be done through management and training  
  * Building trust is a long process, requires training  
  * Need an intentional, targeted plan to help unskilled workers bridge gap to new measures  
  * Need community benefits agreements for new industries  
  * Need communities of practice  
* How to help people manage grants, funding, staff, HR, accounting, etc.  
* Sustainability  
* How to support community in times of economic instability  
* Region is not always prioritized in the long-term  
  * How to prevent neglect of region?  
* Leverage what has been successful with previous projects and how to expand them  
* The hardest thing to learn is how to be middle class; we need to learn how to adapt when things “go pear-shaped”  
  * After we are done clawing our way out of desperation, how do we plan for our own success?

**Employer-supported workforce housing**

* Looks good.  
* In an ideal world this might work. Personally, these live work situations are extremely suspect. What happens if the employer dismissed an employee without just cause? Is their housing now in jeopardy? Why don't we just advocate for building permanently affordable housing, co-ops, or land trusts? Wasn't this a point on the SB playbook?

**Entrepreneurial ecosystem for high-growth startups and Main Street businesses**

* This is the area I am most interested in. It covers the other industry clusters. Without data on demand, many people will propose commodity based businesses that compete only on price rather than on high value added products and services.   
* Initial idea \#2 "Tailor programs..." My suggestion is to pay people to participate in these programs. They do not have extra money unless they work. They could be paid to do the research I recommended for the other industry sectors and learn what needs are out there they might want to meet.   
* This section mentions barriers but does not say what they are. Here is a starting list:  
  * immigration status   
  * employed 7 days a week but still not making ends meet   
  * no inherited wealth due to historic structural racism such as red lining.   
  * no time to acquire skills to create high value added goods and services.   
  * English language learner   
  * Transportation barriers   
  * may have hidden strengths not apparent because of visible disabilities  
* Capacity building must start with skills at determining unmet needs before building prototypes. Since this phase does not generate cash flow, startup founders need funding. Treat them like apprentices.  
* Again, who are we making these strategies for? Community members or institutions? Are we researching who is already doing this work such as Time for Change Foundation? Why not focus on building a local CDFI that is homegrown? How can we ensure that this is community focused and equitable? Who would run a program like this, is it an institution or a community organization?  
* Preschool owners, family childcare owners are often women of color, and many women preschool and childcare business owner have gone out of business due to changes in early childhood education. Need more representation in that sector. Train child care owners to run businesses.  
* Train mainstream business/high growth market workers to understand where unmet needs are in communities  
  * Mentoring in business sectors; train business owners to mentor  
* Include in discussion of entrepreneurship, capacity, infrastructure, etc.  
* Leverage economic drivers  
* Invest in incubators to determine what is needed


**Pathways to careers in management**

* This looks good. Pretty conventional approach. Who is looking to fill management positions? What is the unmet need?  
* Management in what industry? This point is vague. Are we advocating for leadership academies outside of the workplace? Or is this more of an internal goal for each company in the region? Generally, there is a lack of upward mobility in some sectors or specific employers but this point doesn't clarify what we are looking for.  
* We need management 2.0  
  * Build a diverse, thriving coaching and mentoring  
  * Insufficient funding to train   
  * Need sector-based nonprofit management training and apprenticeships  
* Funding for nonprofits  
  * When industries dry up, nonprofits step into the vacuum for community

**Pathways to quality jobs in construction and related trades**

* This looks good. Don't overlook programs for formerly incarcerated. Needs strong pre-apprenticeship programs starting in middle school.  
* This is a point we should be lifting up. HRTP, Plug in IE, IELC, UCR Labor and community center, and IE Labor Institute might be able to comment more on this.

**Pathways to quality jobs in healthcare**

* Connect people getting certifications with training on how to start a successful health care business. Where are their pockets of unmet demand? Needs customer research to see where services are needed most.  
* Another point we should lift. Healthcare is a large industry sector in the region. We should also focus on the unions of healthcare workers and listen to their struggles and get their input on how to make a point like this successful.  
* Why wasn’t health included in the main four priorities?  
* We have a physician desert   
  * Healthcare has good models for growth, but we cannot keep trained doctors here  
  * We are educating nurses and doctors but they don’t stay  
  * How do we get folks to stay?

**Pathways to quality jobs in IT**

* Connect people getting certifications with training on how to start a successful IT business. Where are their pockets of unmet demand? Needs customer research to see where services are needed most.  
* Is this in general or will this also encompass the cybersecurity point? Overall , we just need to make sure that this program is equity based and focuses on the local community. What are some of the higher level needs for IT workers, not just resume writing. Shouldn't that be something that universities already do at their career center? This goes for all points that mentioned resume writing in the context of universities. It can be helpful to again have these services at the local library for those not in university.

**Technology access**

* This looks good. Can we link this focus to the previous one?  
* Another point to lift especially, "Invest in infrastructure improvements to expand broadband access to underserved areas."

**Transportation access**

* Looks good.  
* Generally this is a good start. To the point of "Work with employers to offer transportation benefits or shuttle services." This is a complex issue. We know a lot of IE residents travel to LA or OC to work. Maybe we should shift our focus to advocating for a better, faster, more frequent train system? It already connects folks from IE to LA and OC but also from IE to IE. Plus it would decrease congestion on freeways. Doing this could potentially increase ease of implementation on all the other points.
