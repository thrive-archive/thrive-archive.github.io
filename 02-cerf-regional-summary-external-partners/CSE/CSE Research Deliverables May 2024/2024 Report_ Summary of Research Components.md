 

**Estimate Emissions from the Logistics Industry and Potential Mitigation Strategies**

Directory: Logistics Industry

Objective

Develop estimates of building-related GHG emissions for warehouses, assess the solar potential of warehouse roofs in the region and estimate the GHG emissions from the MHDV fleet associated with the logistics industry.

Approach

We used information about warehouses in the region and their association with energy usage and truck trips to estimate associated emissions. We also examined the potential to mitigate energy usage with rooftop solar installations.

Limitations

* The warehouse energy usage model may not account for all influencing factors, and the sample size could impact accuracy.  
* MHDV emission estimates may not include vehicle idling, leading to potential underestimation of total emissions.  
* Assumptions about roof suitability for solar installations and the lack of precise structural data could impact the accuracy of the solar potential estimates.

**Climate and Environmental Impacts of Sustainable Growth Strategies**

Directory: Impact of Growth Strategies

Objective

Assess the climate impacts of various sustainable growth strategies and identify associated environmental risks.

Approach

We evaluated COâ‚‚ emissions per job added for different growth strategies, ranging from low-emission office-based jobs to high-emission primary material manufacturing. We also examined potential pathways for reducing emissions, including renewable energy adoption and new decarbonization technologies, while identifying environmental risks and mitigation strategies for air, water, and solid waste pollution.

Limitations

* Pollution risks vary widely among businesses, necessitating ongoing regulation and monitoring to ensure environmental safety.  
  


**Ongoing Climate and Environmental Mitigation Program Review**

Directory: Climate Programs

Objective

Review and confirm the details of ongoing climate and environmental mitigation efforts within the local and regional scope, including mandates.

Approach

We generated a comprehensive list of mitigation programs, state and local government mandates, and initiatives from sources such as the Alternative Fuels Data Center. The deliverables include a table grouping programs by type and a text overview of their benefits, which will be referenced in other research task deliverables.

Limitations

* The review depends on the availability and accuracy of program data, which may vary.  
* The list is not comprehensive but we plan on adding to this moving forward.
