**Agreement to Participate in Research (Minor)**  
(For possible use with persons under the age of 18 years)

Your parent or guardian has said that it was okay for you to take part in a research study.  Now we want to ask whether you want to take part in the study.  Just because your parent or guardian said it was okay doesn’t mean that you have to.  It’s really up to you.  No one will be angry if you don’t take part in the study.  No one will mind if you say that you want to take part in it now, but change your mind later.  You can stop participating at any time.

On the rest of this form, you can read some information that will help you decide whether or not you want to participate.  If you have any questions at any time, ask.

As we said up top, you don’t have to participate if you don’t want to.  No one will be angry if you don’t participate.  No one will mind if you say that you want to participate now, but change your mind later.  You can stop what you’re doing in the study at any time.
