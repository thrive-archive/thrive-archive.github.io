**Video/Photo Recording Consent for Community Insights for THRIVE Inland SoCal**

**Why we are conducting video interviews**  
Thrive Inland SoCal is gathering feedback from people who live in Riverside and San Bernardino counties to draft a description of our counties and to use that information to help draft a plan for developing our economy. You can learn more about this work at www.thriveinlandsocal.org. 

**Important things to know about participating**

* Community members are invited to provide feedback regardless of whether or not you participate in the video interview.   
* Thrive Inland Socal will ask for your name to identify your video and to receive your consent, but your name will not be associated with your video unless you opt in.  
* How you participate is solely up to you. You have the right to refuse to answer any question, or stop answering questions at any point without any negative consequences.   
* Community members participating should be 18 and over and may request to see their notes or video.   
* Community members may opt out at any time regarding video recordings, and Thrive Inland SoCal agrees to delete your video recording.
