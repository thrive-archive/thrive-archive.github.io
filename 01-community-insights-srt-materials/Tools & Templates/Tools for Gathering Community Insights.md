         2. If you plan to deliver physical copies of the surveys, collect and store the surveys in a folder that clearly labels the meeting date and meeting details.   
         3. If you plan to deliver digital copies of the surveys, scan the surveys into a computer as PDF documents. Upload these documents to the designated folder on Google Drive. Ensure the folder or each document is marked with the date and meeting name.
