**Details of Group Discussions**

| Barriers Please list some of the ways the barriers below impact how IE residents access good jobs? |  |  |  |
| :---- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Lack of Access to Good Jobs** Education would be the biggest barrier \- lack of HS diploma or GED. Internet service is spotty or sometimes too expensive.  If they do not have training, that’s another obstacle.  Getting the word out to communities about existing opportunities \- limited funding for notifications. |  |  |  |
| **Transportation** Employment barrier. No bus or car living in rural communities, especially in the reservation areas.  Also true for the SB and Riverside area. Worker from La Sierra working in ROV \- asked for a bus pass. Has to leave at 6:45 am and gets to work at 8:00 am. It takes a lot of time to take the bus. Schedules are long.  Participants do have vehicles but there are high maintenance and repair costs.  Participants are in areas where there are resources, like Uber and Lyft. Lack of funds and can participants afford that.  Need alternative ways of transportation. Even carpooling is challenging \- not expensive options. For students, there aren’t many transportation options.  The cost of living doesn’t make it feasible to keep up with maintenance repairs. The roads are narrow and not conducive to bike usage. They’ve purchased bikes in the past, but safety is a barrier.  |  |  |  |
| **Childcare** CIMC has a childcare program that services the majority of the tribes. Even as a city worker, who later became a mom of two, had to become a stay-at-home mom.  Women are affected long-term because of Social Security, lack of contributions, etc.  Not all jobs allow WFH \- when they do, they cut down on transportation costs, food, childcare, etc.  Getting kids from home to another facility might be out of the way to work. Need more employer ownership for providing greater and more affordable access to childcare so that their workers can get to work comfortably.  |  |  |  |
| **Other Barriers** Housing access Employees with prior convictions Lack of assistance with resume building/writing Access to use of technology to find jobs Algebra knowledge is needed and no training for this More youth are not going on to college because of the overwhelming financial burden that carries on for decades and that has ripple community-wide effects. |  |  |  |
| **Solutions** *Please share any solutions or ideas that you have for how to address barriers to good jobs in the IE.* More online classes to help with educational advancement. Uber/Lyft partnerships Employer subsidized child care or grants Leveraging resources with other organizations Short term participation programs Expanding  outreach to existing events and meetings like the Downtown Riverside Farmers Market |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |
| **Organizations/Programs** Please list any organizations, projects and/or programs that you know of that are doing a great job of addressing barriers to accessing good jobs in our region. TANF Program \- good at referring individuals and preparing them for work.  Great relationship with tribes for exploring work sites to prepare for employment for short term work experience. Some tribes will later hire them.  Trades 10-12 individuals who have been hired with job readiness and employment. Going through the journeyman process and then going through apprenticeships. Outreach is a work in progress.  |  |  |  |
