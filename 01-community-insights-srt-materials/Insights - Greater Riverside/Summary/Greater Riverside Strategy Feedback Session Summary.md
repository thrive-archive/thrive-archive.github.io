# **Greater Riverside Strategy Feedback Session Summary**

## **Summary of Key Points**

The Greater Riverside Meeting was held virtually on 5/15/2024 and 3 people attended. The agenda included topics on economic mobility and wealth building and identifying important industries for economic development. Raw notes recorded by Jin Zhu.

The 3 overarching topics identified were; Economic and Workforce Development, Community and Environmental Initiatives, and Well-rounded Communities.

**Economic and Workforce Development:**

* Leverage Riverside's strategic position to develop manufacturing hubs and sustainable supply chains, focusing on zero-emission vehicles.  
* Invest in trade schools and on-site job training for technical professions, and promote pathways to quality jobs in construction, healthcare, IT, and management through partnerships with local unions, schools, and community colleges.  
* Emphasize small business development, ongoing support for startups, and social equity projects, including in the cannabis and beauty industries.  
* Invest in CBOs, nonprofits, and social enterprise as a sector. Otherwise, strategies will need to include community benefits agreement to ensure equity.  
* Combine Catalyst with other funding to maximize impact.

**Community and Environmental Initiatives:**

* Create clean jobs to improve public health and economic mobility, and develop pedestrian-friendly transportation infrastructure.  
* Support technology access programs for low-income residents and incentivize non-profits to partner with employers for low-cost childcare.  
* Invest in cultural and social capital through community-based organizations and promote DEI training to foster inclusivity and combat anti-blackness.  
* Invest in environmental waste technologies, such as citrus bioflavonoids and/or palm fronds.

**Well-rounded Communities:**

* Support worker-owned co-ops, collectives, land trusts, housing co-ops, and local businesses to address gentrification and ensure projects benefit existing marginalized residents (Black, Brown, Indigenous, API).  
* Increase community services and amenities like family home day care, agriculture/community gardens, after-school care, free libraries, health promoters, and engagement programs.  
* Promote existing programs at San Bernardino Valley College and CalWorks that support working and student parents and their children.

**Raw Notes**

1. Advanced manufacturing  
   1. According to regional studies greater Riverside is perfectly positioned for logistics since nearly [40%](https://www.portoflosangeles.org/tariffshurt#:~:text=How%20does%20trade%20through%20the,state%20in%20the%20map%20below.) of imported goods pass through Los Angeles ports, and eventually the IE. Therefore, if we can have manufactures to build or supply the rest of the US they can be transported with other imported goods; or we can be an alternative supplier for the imported items.  
   2. Strategy: Develop manufacturing hubs and sustainable supply chains and invest in zero-emission vehicles sector  
   3. “Norco College has one of the best manufacturing training programs in our region.” Develop community college network of programs like these. “Add incentives for privately-held organizations, such as UEI College, to provide similar programs.

2. Business services  
   1. With several Unions and industry complexes in the region, we should invest in a cluster of trade schools such as; Stationary engineers, boiler operators, electric power-line installers, computer network architects, elevator installers, telephone operators, fire inspectors, wind turbine technicians. That’ll encourage these trade businesses to set up shop nearby as well.  
   2. “Community-Based Development Organizations and other local nonprofits  
      represent a rapidly growing sector that offers higher incomes than private sector jobs across all tradable clusters. The Thrive Research Team also recognized the nonprofit sector for providing quality jobs in its Economy and Economic Development and Industry Clusters (Brookings) Narrative. Social enterprises launched by nonprofits are capable of delivering both sector-specific strategies for priority tradable clusters, and sector-neutral strategies for wealth-building and economic mobility.” For more, see: [reviewer raw notes](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cCKgGLZRThxOspR1ub0juAWEYoL9bToq/view).

     
3. Cleantech  
   1. Since logistics is nearly 30% of IE jobs, it created poor health as an unintended consequence. Therefore, creating clean jobs will combat health while creating opportunities for residents to learn a new skill set that will make them competitive and clean up our region. This could strengthen our regions public health and economic mobility 

   

4. Sustainable supply chains  
   1. It would make sense to foster manufacturer to provide supplies or maintenance for zero-emission vehicles, especially because the greater Riverside is position to import items to the rest of the US

   

5. Access to childcare  
   1. Incentivising non-profits to partner with employers to offer low-cost childcare on-site or nearby. Similar offer low-cost to free childcare at Libraries or apartment complexes (recreation room)

   

6. Access to the education and training needed for quality jobs  
   1. Incentivising employers to bring back/offer job training on-site after hired  

   

7. Building cultural and social capital  
   1. Investing and empowering CBOs to lead local studies/initiatives of what best works for their regional culture can create pathways/pipelines to high paying jobs. Local economic development/chamber of commerce can provide technical assistance with business and CBO’s to create and maintain pipelines within the community 

   

8. Employer-supported workforce housing  
   1. Provide some level or hybrid of social housing seeing in successful European models to refer to government-owned or regulated affordable housing.

   

9. Entrepreneurial ecosystem for high-growth startups and Main Street businesses  
   1. Following other models throughout the nation would behoove the Greater Riverside, but tailoring to its culture would be inclusive.

   

10. Pathways to careers in management  
    1. Subsides employers with funding to create management programs on company time for diverse employees \- job training on-site

11. Pathways to quality jobs in construction and related trades  
    1. This proposal is a strong option since we have great unions position to create and strengthen a pipeline from schools to trade schools 

    

12. Pathways to quality jobs in healthcare  
    1. Widening the pathway with much more public awareness about free to low-cost training for healthcare jobs can foster diverse workforce including promoting at high school level. 

    

13. Pathways to quality jobs in IT  
    1. UCR and other community colleges are centrally located to offer and expand such pathways

    

14. Technology access  
    1. Programs like County of Riverside [Community Action Partnership](https://capriverside.org/tech-success) is one way to get technology in the hands of low-income residents, this is feasible with a sustainable budget. 

    

15. Transportation access  
    1. Building pedestrian friendly culture by implementing two lanes in mainstreet/downtown areas (as we did during the pandemic) or outdoor seating is a way to foster pedestrian friendly culture that increases cycling, walking, and public transportation.   
       

**General Feedback:**

* We have the opportunity to really innovate and support alternative models like worker owned co-ops, collectives, land trusts, housing co-ops, etc. We need to keep funds local and support spots like Slow Bloom in Redlands vs Starbucks Corp that exports our profits outside of the IE  
* Imagine a world where families can have family home day care, neighborhood argriculture/community garden, afterschool care, little free libraries, health promotores & robust community engagement programs\!  
* So addressing Gentrification.... and making sure these projects don't push out the folks who already live here.   Especially things like anti-blackness.... paying close attention to who benefits & who leads these projects.  
* In addition to the Child Development Resource and Referral there is something called trustline… where you can have a family member get paid to provide child care.  
* Imposter syndrome is so real\!\!\!\! Trying to figure out is the failure of the leadership, the system and govt, not the failure of our community members. add hair care to micro kitchens, child care & food as medicine … food/plants as hair & body care, herbal remedy etc.  
* How do we take the competition between communities OUT of the consideration, in other words.... these projects & funding must go to multiple communities, black, brown, indigenous, API …. and LED by these communities so no one is left out.  
* Do folks know about Social Equity projects?  … for example in Cannabis industry?  
* Small business development & ongoing not just start up\!  
* This plan can also addressed restorative justice  
* Anti Bias training too\!  
* How can we find a way to pay caregivers who can provide childcare   
  * Existing programs exist such as San Bernardino Valley College and through CalWorks (Childcare Resource That Referral) , where parents can attend while children attend preschool at the same time  
* We need to highlight and make “social equity” projects a forefront in these efforts.   
* How can we fund the beauty industry to be carbon-neutral as well?   
* There is a disconnect here, this is traditional economic development. As if these solutions are something you can pull off a shelf and plug a person into. But that's not how this works, and we'd hate to lose 9 million dollars of opportunity for pilot project funding. If we could do something differently.  
* “Catalyst funds provide greater impact when they are combined with other funding sources.” Ex: Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds, AmPac Business Capital, the Western Education Institute, and the MicroEnterprise Collaborative of Inland Southern California.  
* If the nonprofit sector is excluded from this plan, there will be “greater reliance on community benefit agreements with private companies to ensure equity, sustainability and quality jobs. With nonprofit community-based development, these elements are embedded organically through mission focus and local governance.”
