*The Thrive Inland SoCal community is pivoting from developing a regional economic development plan to actively supporting the plan together in our next phase of work: Phase 3\. Phase 3 will focus on:*

* *Enacting our Regional Economic Plan (REP) strategies together*  
* *Aligning Catalyst projects with Regional Economic Plan (REP) strategies*  
* *Collectively continuing to build social infrastructure and momentum to pursue our Regional Economic Plan (REP) goals beyond Thrive*   
    
  *In October, SRTs will reorganize from 6 to 4 subregional tables and shift to a new organizational structure for Phase 3\. As Phase 2 work closes, we would like to pause, reflect, and celebrate the work our SRT has done together over the past year\! We also need your help to plan for Phase 3 and to actively support the Regional Economic Plan we created together.*

  *In our September SRT meeting, we will be hosting a 30-45 minute retrospective and future planning session. We want to learn together what worked well, what new lessons we learned about our region, and what practices should be continued to make future inclusive economic development planning successful. We need your support to: continue building momentum together, enact our Regional Economic Plan (REP), set short- and long-term goals, and align Catalyst projects with our plan.*

  *Your voice matters\! If you have been involved with our SRT for 6 months or longer, we need you there to reflect on the work our SRT has done and to begin thinking forward about building momentum and laying the groundwork in support of our Regional Economic Plan (REP). If you have only recently joined us in the last few months, no worries. We need your help to plan for the future\!*


  *Please note: The retrospective and forward thinking session will not include a discussion of Catalyst Funding. For all questions regarding funding, please contact Esmeralda Vazquez at: [evazquez@ielaborinstitute.org](mailto:evazquez@ielaborinstitute.org)* 

  *Please join us (in-person/online) on (date/time) at (place) for this important reflection and planning for the future.*
