## Summary of Key Themes

The Southwest Riverside SRT came together to discuss barriers to quality jobs and financial well-being. The group reviewed data on the number of quality jobs and, and the percentage of residents who are struggling. The attendees broke into 3 focus groups and were tasked with identifying 3-5 barriers to quality jobs and barriers that are most challenging for disinvested communities. The barriers that were identified include;

* Resources for veterans  
* Childcare  
* Too many requirements for entry-level jobs  
* Lack of career coaching  
* Lack of a 4-year research university in the sub-region  
* Lack of resources to access higher education/training

| Key Themes | Tally Count (Groups) |
| :---- | :---- |
| Resources for veterans | The discussion here was centered on the disjointed resources available for veteran job seekers and entrepreneurs. It was acknowledged that there are many resources for veterans, but that despite this, veterans have difficulty knowing about them or accessing them. The region has a very high ratio of veterans in our community and veterans are more likely to be unemployed or underemployed than their counterparts.  |
| Childcare | This was a theme in all three breakouts. The themes that were touched are were lack of availability, high cost, parental concerns over quality of care, and lack of hours that work for non-traditional hours (evenings, weekends, early morning). Potential solutions that were generated were subsidized programs that lower the cost for all children, a wage floor for childcare workers to reduce turnover and make it more desirable, quality jobs, grants to help existing providers expand, and working with community colleges to train new workers. |
| Requirements for entry-level jobs | This conversation discussed that many entry level jobs have requirements in the job posting that are beyond what would be needed for the job. These high requirements discourages people who could otherwise do the job from applying and prevents them from a potential career ladder. |
| Lack of career coaching  | This barrier was discussed in the context of people, mainly youth being unaware of how to enter into a career or what careers are available to them in the region. |
| Lack of 4-year research university in the region | While UCR is in Riverside, many people in the breakout group discussed feeling like it was too far for most people to access it and that the lack of a 4-year university within a commutable distance was contributing to the lack of bachelor degree attainment, particularly for disadvantaged youth. Also, the lack of a 4-year research university was also a contributing factor to more high-tech employers not choosing to locate in the sub region. |
| Lack of resources to access higher education | This discussion touched on the high cost of higher education and that many young people are hesitant to take on debt, particularly if they do not see the opportunity for a high-wage job in their community. There was also discussion about the lack of resources for low-income populations to know how to get financial aid to attend school/training. |
