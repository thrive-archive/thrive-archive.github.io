# Western San Bernardino SRT Meeting Summary

March 7, 2024

**OVERVIEW:**

During the hybrid March 7th SRT meeting, the attending Western San Bernardino residents participated in a mapping exercise to discuss barriers to opportunity within the region as well as ways to overcome them. Participants were split into one of five groups either in person or through digital breakout rooms and answered the following questions. This overview will follow the main barriers cataloged by the groups and how groups answered the remaining question for each barrier.

**QUESTIONS:**

1. What are existing barriers to opportunity in the region?  
2. How does this barrier show up in this subregion vs. other areas?  
3. Which disinvested communities & demographics are affected by this barrier?  
4. What are solutions to this barrier that are working & should be expanded?  
5. What are potential solutions to remaining gaps?  
6. What are some opportunities for collaboration & coordination to overcome this barrier?

**THEMES:**

The barriers to opportunity discussed across all groups fall under six main categories:

| Barrier | Mentions Across All Groups |
| :---- | :---- |
| Knowledge of Services & Opportunities | 16 |
| Transportation | 11 |
| Education & Training Access | 11 |
| Job Access & Entrepreneurship | 8 |
| Childcare Access | 6 |

In the following sections, a number in parentheses means that is the number of times a theme was mentioned. For example, the (3) at the end of this phrase means that this idea was mentioned three times: Meet with community members to spread program information and *“be active everyday in the community”* (3).

**Knowledge of Services & Opportunities**

A major barrier that impacted most, if not all, other barriers that groups discussed included a lack of knowledge of existing services & opportunities. All five groups mentioned a lack of knowledge around job opportunities or critical documentation to access good jobs at least once (6). 4 groups also mentioned the need for better advertising and information sharing on existing services in general. Some also pointed out that this information gap isn’t only due to a lack of advertising, but also a lack of community networking. One group explained that *“Investors don’t actually know what communities \[need their services\].”* Three groups also claimed that information is not being shared among community members due to a *“lack of a welcome center,”* *“no pride or sense in community,”* and *“people are not willing to see past their social circles.”*

Notably, one group also acknowledged that a *“stigma to services”* exists that may push people away from utilizing existing programs. The group did not elaborate further.

Solutions to this knowledge sharing issue combine organization advertising and community network building:

* Existing services and organizations should:  
  * Meet with community members to spread program information and *“be active everyday in the community”* (3)  
  * *“use funding, media outlets \+ get the word out \[on\] these resources”*  
  * *“\[Organize\] workshops, fun/relaxing community gettogethers that collaborate with organizations that want to help”*  
  * Collaborate with cities and communities to improve engagement (2). One group noted *“City council should be at these \[SRT\] meetings”*  
* Community members should:  
  * Meet together and share resources and information (2)

**Transportation**

Transportation-related barriers represented a very clear challenge for all groups, mentioned 11 times across group discussions. Groups highlighted specific issues like commuting time, constant construction, public transit gaps, and cost of transport, and noted that specific populations like students, youth, families, people of color, and the elderly are most affected by these barriers. Two groups also mentioned that those near the West End and the south side of Ontario Holt Blvd are adversely affected by transportation issues. These transportation issues can act as a barrier to accessing quality jobs. As one group wrote, *“Disinvested communities struggle to get from place to place. Cars are expensive to maintain, and community may need to rely on public transportation, which diminishes job opportunities.”* Long distances and long commute times can also affect community access to childcare: “*Public transportation is time consuming. Child care is often far from jobs. Community resources are oriented to cars, making family management difficult.”*

Group discussions did come up with several ways to overcome these problems, culminating in 5 unique solutions :

* Coordinating between communities and Metrolink to plan transit hubs around community resources such as clean jobs, childcare, healthcare, shopping, culture (4 groups)  
* Toll lanes, economic burden traffic lanes (1)  
* Co-ops for transportation (1)  
* Public-owned scooters (1)  
* Tunnels \[perhaps to reduce traffic burdens\] (1)

**Education & Training Access**

Access to education and training were also frequently mentioned barriers, with 11 mentions across all groups. The two main issues for all groups in this category seemed to be difficulty obtaining a college degree and lack of knowledge of or access to workforce development and education outside of a college. A college degree could help residents qualify for jobs that have education requirements (2), but nearby colleges can be too expensive for some groups (3) or may not be accessible to populations such as neurodivergent individuals (1). Some groups noted not knowing of any opportunities for workforce development outside of college or what jobs & fields do not necessarily require a college degree (2), and that this lack of knowledge especially affected young people in the community (2). Others knew they needed specific courses on topics such as computer skills, professional development, and other essential skillsets, but did not know where to go to access such courses (3).

Group members had a handful of proposed solutions for these barriers:

Solutions for Education access:

* Encouraging organizations to provide training programs and workshops on essential skills (2)  
* State funded access to education through lower college tuitions or incentivized training programs (1)

Solutions for Knowledge of Education Opportunities:

* One group recommended *“strengthening SBCUSD partnerships to share diverse job opportunities”*  
* Another suggested a *“CAPS Program \- LLUH Service Learning Coordinator, \[and\] K-12 Partnerships”* to increase knowledge of college alternatives.  
* *An AI-generated pathway for students that connects them to \[relevant\] organizations* (1)

**Job Access & Entrepreneurship**

Issues surrounding job access and difficulties with entrepreneurship also represented significant barriers in group discussions. Three groups mentioned the region has a lack of good jobs or job diversity, with 2/3 saying this is due to the types of industries and sectors operating in the region. As one group put it, jobs are *“Mostly warehouse, everyone’s leaving.”* Another group summed up why this is a part of a larger issue: *“\[The\] community takes jobs with limited opportunity: working out of necessity \- not necessarily passion for work and jobs with economic opportunity”* Several groups also discussed barriers for entrepreneurs in the region, noting that access to capital (2) is a major issue for budding businesses.

To solve these issues, groups suggested:

* Focusing more on the tourism sector (1)  
* Get businesses to move to the IE (1)  
* Craft DEI initiatives differently (1)  
* Provide capacity building and risk management courses for businesses (2)

**Childcare**

Access to childcare came up as an important barrier six times in group discussions. Although some groups weren’t specific as to how or why this was a barrier, two groups noted that childcare was difficult to access due to high costs or long distances. One group also mentioned that childcare access specifically impacts women, families, and people of color. There were few specific suggested solutions to childcare access outside of improving transportation issues, however, one group did note that South Ontario near Chino would be a good place for a school. Two others suggested separately that *“education should start earlier”* and there should be *“community partnerships allowed in school districts,”* which may also be referencing childcare solutions.

**Other Barriers**

Some groups also mentioned barriers outside of these main categories. These include:

* High cost-of living  
* Access to healthcare  
* Access to affordable housing
