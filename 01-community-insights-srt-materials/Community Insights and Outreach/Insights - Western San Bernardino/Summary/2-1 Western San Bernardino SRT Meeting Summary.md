February 1, 2024

## Discussion Questions

"How should we as a collective reach out and engage disinvested communities? What has worked for you and your groups?"

"How can we overcome barriers to engaging specific groups, like youth, street vendors, language communities, etc.?"

"How should we as a sub-region message what we are trying to achieve with this collaborative economic development effort? Do you have suggestions for taglines?"

## Summary of Key Themes

This community gathering of Thrive West end was a focus on outreach and the ways in which disinvested communities can most effectively be engaged. Participants joined one of 5 breakout groups for a discussion around community engagement and equitable access for these communities. This report serves to summarize their valuable feedback and suggestions for promoting successful involvement by community members with the goal of providing insight to event organizers as they endeavor to host successful outreach events and help community members contribute to the Thrive regional economic development planning process.

Each group was asked to provide their thoughts and recommendations for community outreach, specifically related to past successes, potential barriers to future success with engagement of specific groups, and overall messaging.

Attendees who participated in the survey placed the highest focus on community outreach, with suggestions for engagement with the community that included handing out bilingual flyers to street vendors to share with their customers, passing out business cards, exchanging emails, sending out postcards and connecting with youth through social media. One attendee associated community outreach with “*building trust*.”

Another significant recommendation was collaboration with local groups and organizations such as community health workers, churches, local businesses, schools, local school districts working with family engagement centers, and community leaders. One attendee spoke to how these collaborations can have a positive impact, stating that “*Many have connections with the community and are welcomed due to resources they have shared with the community*.”

Barriers to access as a notable concern were mentioned by 3 out of 5 groups. Among the barriers listed were economic, language and technology access barriers as well as meeting access barriers related to the location and the time of day that community meetings are held, suggesting that organizers need to "*meet people where they are*".

Another recommendation brought forward was community resources that would provide more services and assistance to the community. These included backpack drives, food drives, toy drives and health fairs. One attendee stated that “*More resources provide the community with more hope*.”

And, finally, attendees cited the importance of attending community events, with comments like "*Plug into events that are already happening*.” Suggestions were made to participate in local events such as flea markets, farmer’s markets, and art events.

The table below summarizes the tally counts of key themes that emerged from the group discussions:

| Key Themes | Tally Count (Groups) |
| :---- | :---- |
| Community Outreach | 17 total mentions across all 5 groups2 groups specifically mentioned the idea of outreach being meeting people where they are. |

After reviewing the group responses there appears to be a significant desire by the community members to improve and increase the level of engagement with disinvested communities and, in doing so, see successful involvement by the highest number of residents in the region. Overall recommendations include a wider variety of outreach initiatives and more equitable access that enables residents to feel like they have a voice in what programs are designed and implemented to benefit the community.

## Potential Additional Questions for Exploration Based on Group Responses:

* **Community Group Coalition** \- Could a coalition of community groups and organizations be established to align efforts most effectively?  
* **Impact and Insights** \- How can community impact be measured? What tools can be used to determine how efforts made have impacted the community and where they have made the most difference?  
* **Resource Identification** \- What services and resources should be prioritized to best serve the community?

Answers to these questions may help to create a better understanding of the responses received from the first event and aid in providing more clarity and understanding of how best to serve community needs.
