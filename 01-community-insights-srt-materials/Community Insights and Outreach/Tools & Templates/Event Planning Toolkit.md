Hello \[Name or organization\],

I am XXXXX  XXXXX and represent Thrive Inland SoCal, a collaborative funded by California Jobs First, formerly known as the Community Economic Resilience Fund (CERF). CERF was created by the California Legislature to promote a sustainable and equitable recovery from the economic distress from the COVID-19 pandemic by supporting new plans and strategies to diversify local economies and develop sustainable industries that create high-quality, broadly accessible jobs for all Californians.  

We are currently gathering insights from organizations like yours and your members important to what an inclusive economic development plan should look like for your community. This information will be submitted to XXX for further funding consideration to assist with the economic growth of our Inland Empire communities. I am reaching out to gauge interest in opportunities for your community members to participate in conversations to better understand where they would like to see our region’s economy grow.

If this is of interest, please contact me. I also can provide more details on our efforts and explain our timeline for completing this community input phase. 

Thank you for your time and consideration. 

Thank you,
