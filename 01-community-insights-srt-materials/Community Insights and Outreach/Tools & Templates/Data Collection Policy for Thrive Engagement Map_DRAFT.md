**Data Collection Policy for Thrive Inland SoCal Engagement Map DRAFT**

A key part of Thrive Inland SoCal’s deliverable to the state is community engagement mapping, which will demonstrate to the state Thrive’s inclusive planning process and commitment to equity and include:

* A snapshot of the community members and groups that can influence creating a high road economy and/or benefit from it.  
* A list of organizations and entities and their role in developing the process and regional plan, which will include, but is not limited to employers, businesses, community-based organizations, community members and residents, government and economic development agencies, labor organizations, philanthropic organizations, academic institutions, education and training providers, workforce entities, and industries. These community members have been identified as [affinity groups](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1unv6QOePd0feVz1ifOuxTC4ieli2y3xc99R0B_xdXtI/edit).  
* A visual representation of communities and affinity groups engaged in Thrive’s inclusive planning process.

Note: Data collection for the Thrive Inland SoCal Engagement Map will ideally reach out to and include as many [affinity groups](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1unv6QOePd0feVz1ifOuxTC4ieli2y3xc99R0B_xdXtI/edit) as is feasible in all areas in our region. SRTs and committees may use this [template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xe-7gM5Xk-4L-eHiAyknDvJiMq_bf9usgoTrxq934qc/edit) to establish outreach goals and this [tracking tool](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/104d4mE_CdyiBPiHUqd9VUsIvt7EKPMvIF0h4-kwhXyA/edit?usp=sharing) to record engagement for the map.

The Center for Sustainable Energy (CSE) Outreach & Engagement (O\&E) Team will provide support to SRTs and committees compiling and merging existing engagement lists and data collection processes for the engagement map.

**Thrive Engagement Map Data Collection Policies**

* Affinity Group Outreach Plan – SRTs and committees will collaborate with the CSE O\&E Team to establish intentional goals to [plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xe-7gM5Xk-4L-eHiAyknDvJiMq_bf9usgoTrxq934qc/edit) outreach to a broad variety of community members in affinity groups for the engagement map (and the planning process).  
* Affinity Group Outreach Goal Setting   
  * Goals and Purpose Communication – SRTs and committees will strive to communicate clearly the data collection goals for the map.  
  * Target Affinity Group Outreach – SRTs and committees will establish goals for including a targeted number of affinity groups, e.g., reach X affinity groups, reach X geographies.  
  * Target Outreach Numbers – SRTs and committees will establish goals for including a targeted number of individuals in affinity groups, e.g., reach X number of individuals, reach X number of affinity groups.  
* Engagement Map Collection Methods – SRTs and committees will collaborate with the CSE O\&E Team on data collection methods for the map, which include:  
  * Self-Identification at Events or Meetings – SRTs and committees will ask attendees to complete a survey to self-select their own affinity group affiliation and/or industry/sector. Ideally, this would be a 2-minute activity during SRT, committee, and general Thrive meetings.   
  * Interactive Map – SRTs and committees will work with CSE O\&E Team to create an interactive map to show Thrive participant activity by cities, opportunity zones, organization names, etc.  
  * Networking Opportunities – SRTs and committees will collaborate with CSE O\&E Team to provide downloadable lists of participating organizations and will update lists periodically with new participants.   
* Transparency and Privacy – Thrive does not make assumptions or publish information community members do not want published.   
  * Organizations and adult individuals can self-select how much information to make public. Individuals would be geographically located at city centers. Individual addresses will not be published.   
  * Minor youth community members would be represented in aggregate by city or sub-region. The hover over box would display only the number of youth participants for the city/sub-region. If there are less than five youths from a particular city, the number of youths would be aggregated at the sub-regional level.  
  * At the center of the city/sub-region, there will be a dot representing the number of youth participating from that city or sub-region.In the downloadable list, youth members' names will be listed as "youth member" and their city or sub-region.  
* SRT and Committee Member Roles & Responsibilities – SRTs and committees will work with CSE O\&E Team to establish roles and responsibilities for map data collection at events and meetings, e.g., Person A is responsible for xyz and their role is to administer the engagement map survey, Person B will update the engagement tracker, etc.  
* Translation and Interpretation – SRTs and committees will work with the CSE O\&E Team to provide Spanish translation, where needed for the engagement map.  
* Addressing Gaps in Data – SRTs and committees will meet regularly with the CSE O\&E Team to identify gaps in outreach and data collection for the map and to brainstorm outreach methods.
