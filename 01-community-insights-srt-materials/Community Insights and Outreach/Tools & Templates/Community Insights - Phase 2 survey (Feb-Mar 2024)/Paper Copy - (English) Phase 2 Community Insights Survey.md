# Thrive Engagement Map Opt-in: Get Counted and Represent Our Region\! (2 minutes)

We are asking the following questions to provide an opportunity for you to be represented in our interactive Thrive Engagement Map, a visual tool that highlights community participation and insights.

The engagement map (shown below) will visually display community members’ and organizations’ participation, organized by sub-region. This helps us ensure that every area is fairly represented. Organizations are allowed to have a “dot” on the map at their specific address. To protect confidential information like personal addresses, individuals will only be allowed to have a “dot” on the map at a city center or subregion center.

# Community Insights: Share Your Vision for Our Region's Future\! (20-25 minutes)

We are collecting this information to understand your perspectives on employment opportunities and identify economic development strengths and gaps that exist within our region. Your input will inform the selection of regional priorities and strategies for sustainable economic growth. These priorities and strategies will be included in the Thrive regional economic development plan. Please answer the following questions with **your sub-region** in mind. For a map and list of cities organized by six subregions, see the “Subregional Table'' section of [https://www.thriveinlandsocal.org/](https://www.thriveinlandsocal.org/). 

Your responses to these questions will be aggregated with others’ responses when reported to the Thrive community and any quotes used in summaries or reports will not be attributed to specific individuals. 

## JOB AVAILABILITY

When answering these questions, think of a “quality job” as one that, at minimum, pays a wage allowing a family to cover basic living expenses and accumulate some savings each month, provides employer-sponsored health insurance, and offers stable long-term employment or leads to another quality job over the next ten years.

1. How much do you agree that the economy in your sub-region offers opportunities for residents to secure a quality job by age 30, even if you personally don’t have one at this time?  
     
   1. 1 – Strongly Disagree  
   2. 2 – Disagree  
   3. 3 – Neutral  
   4. 4 – Agree   
   5. 5 – Strongly Agree 

   

2. How long do you think is a reasonable one-way commuting time to access a quality job?  
     
   1. 1 – No more than 30 minutes  
   2. 2 – Up to 60 minutes  
   3. 3 – Up to 90 minutes  
   4. 4 – Up to two hours

   

3. What do you think are the top three things needed to make more quality jobs available to more residents in your sub-region?  
   

## WORKER RESOURCES FOR JOB ACCESS

Prior surveys identified many barriers to access quality jobs, such as gaps in training and “learn-and-earn” options, childcare, transportation, language, re-entry from incarceration, and placement services.

4. Do you know where and how to access existing resources in your sub-region that would enable access to quality jobs? Circle Yes or No  
   1. If yes, where do you look for help? 

   

   

5. In general, what do you think has been effective (or ineffective) about efforts to provide entry-level job training and placement in your community?  
     
     
     
6. What do you think has been effective (or ineffective) about helping residents already in the workforce to prepare for and find better quality jobs?  
     
     
7. What organizations in your sub-region do you think are most helpful in supporting workers trying to prepare for, find, and successfully obtain quality jobs? (list all, and can be non-profit, government, or business)  
     
     
8. What are up to five effective programs or services that you are aware of that help improve access to quality jobs, which could be scaled up to assist more people? (list up to five)

## PARTNERSHIPS

The ability of different organizations – civic, government, educational, and business – to work together on common goals is a hallmark of successful regions offering economic opportunity and quality of life. 

9. What are examples of effective partnerships among three organizations that have achieved a real outcome by working together? These can be organizations in your sub-region or more broadly.  
     
     
10. What five community or civic organizations in your sub-region do you think are absolutely essential to deliver on a vision of greater economic opportunity for all residents, whether or not they currently are involved in THRIVE Inland SoCal?  
      
      
11. What businesses or business groups come to mind as responsible members of the community that are invested in residents and the future of the region?  
      
      
12. What other businesses or business groups in the sub-region may be critical to involve achieving THRIVE Inland SoCal objectives, whether or not you currently consider them to be trustworthy partners?
