# Community Insights Collection Policy DRAFT

Central to the values established through governance is inclusive and data-driven decision-making. Community insights collection is a key part of our qualitative data collection, as we need to hear from a broad variety of stakeholders, 13 [affinity groups](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1unv6QOePd0feVz1ifOuxTC4ieli2y3xc99R0B_xdXtI/edit), community members, and disinvested communities. As part of our cooperative decision-making process, Thrive Inland SoCal is committed to the collection, review, and evaluation of relevant qualitative data, using equity-focused methods. “Community insights” are the qualitative data that will support decision-making.

Note: Community insights collection will ideally include outreach to as many [affinity groups](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1unv6QOePd0feVz1ifOuxTC4ieli2y3xc99R0B_xdXtI/edit) as is feasible. Thrive Inland SoCal Sub-Regional Tables (SRTs) and committees may use this [template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xe-7gM5Xk-4L-eHiAyknDvJiMq_bf9usgoTrxq934qc/edit) to establish outreach goals. 

The Center for Sustainable Energy (CSE) Outreach & Engagement (O\&E) Team will provide support to SRTs and committees in community insights collection planning, processes, summarization, and archiving.

## Community Insights Collection Policies at Events and Meetings
