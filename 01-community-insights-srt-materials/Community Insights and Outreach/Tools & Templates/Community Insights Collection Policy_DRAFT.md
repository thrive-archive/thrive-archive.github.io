**Community Insights Collection Policy DRAFT**

Central to the values established through governance is inclusive and data-driven decision-making. Community insights collection is a key part of our qualitative data collection, as we need to hear from a broad variety of stakeholders, 13 [affinity groups](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1unv6QOePd0feVz1ifOuxTC4ieli2y3xc99R0B_xdXtI/edit), community members, and disinvested communities. As part of our cooperative decision-making process, Thrive Inland SoCal is committed to the collection, review, and evaluation of relevant qualitative data, using equity-focused methods. “Community insights” are the qualitative data that will support decision-making.

Note: Community insights collection will ideally include outreach to as many [affinity groups](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1unv6QOePd0feVz1ifOuxTC4ieli2y3xc99R0B_xdXtI/edit) as is feasible. Thrive Inland SoCal Sub-Regional Tables (SRTs) and committees may use this [template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xe-7gM5Xk-4L-eHiAyknDvJiMq_bf9usgoTrxq934qc/edit) to establish outreach goals. 

The Center for Sustainable Energy (CSE) Outreach & Engagement (O\&E) Team will provide support to SRTs and committees in community insights collection planning, processes, summarization, and archiving.

**Community Insights Collection Policies at Events and Meetings**

* Community Insights Collection Goal Setting   
  * Focus and Purpose – SRTs and committees will collaborate with the CSE O\&E Team and respond to Data Committee and Research Team needs in setting goals for community insights collection for events and meetings, e.g., what central questions or themes to explore, what are the listening goals, what does Thrive Inland SoCal need to learn from the community, what is the purpose of the event, etc.  
    * Phase 1 Focus (\~December 2023 by   
      * Business and Community Leaders and Community Engagement, Art & Culture Committees collaborate with CSE and Data Committee to host events to gather community insights on descriptions of a good job, climate, health, and community-identified issues  
    * Phase 2 Focus (January-May 2024\)   
      * SRTs and committees collaborate with CSE O\&E Team to gather community insights to include in the regional plan  
    * Phase 3 Focus (June-August 2024\)   
      * SRTs and committees collaborate with CSE O\&E Team to gather community feedback on the regional plan  
  * Goals and Purpose Communication – SRTs and committees will strive to communicate clearly the community insights collection goals, purpose, and timeline at all events and meetings.

* Community Insights Collection Methods – SRTs and committees will collaborate with the CSE O\&E Team to establish clear methods for community insights collection for events and meetings, e.g, survey, interviews, focus groups, etc. for Phase 2 and 3\.  
* SRT and Committee Member Roles & Responsibilities – SRTs and committees will work with CSE O\&E Team to establish roles and responsibilities for community insights collection events and meetings, e.g., Person A is responsible for xyz and their role is Point of Contact; Person B is responsible for xyz and their role is event activity facilitator; Person C is notetaker, etc.  
* Translation and Interpretation – SRTs and committees will work with CSE O\&E Team to establish process and timeline for written materials translated into Spanish and live interpretation.

**Accessibility and Transparency Policies**

That said, CSE will not promise confidentiality or anonymity due to the highly interactive and transparent data collection and communication approach taken for this work.   
  * Language for survey that does not insinuate full confidentiality, but offers some level of privacy related to reporting findings: Your responses to these questions will be aggregated with others’ responses when reported to the Thrive community and any quotes used in summaries or reports will not be attributed to specific individuals.   
* Data Sovereignty – Thrive Inland SoCal will collectively determine how community insights might be used and archived outside Thrive Inland SoCal work after July 1, 2024\. All community insights by tribal communities will be delivered to tribes unless otherwise indicated after July 1, 2024\.   
* Community Review & Feedback – Community members who have contributed insights may review summaries to ensure that summaries accurately reflect their ideas and what was recorded in the raw notes. Community members who wish to review may provide comments as follows:

    * When summaries are uploaded into folders, SRTs and committees will be notified via email.  
    * SRTs and committees are responsible for ensuring event participants are alerted to provide comments. The summaries are available as “comment only.”  
    * Event and meeting participants will provide comments on the summaries for clarification, context, and any other adjustments.  
    * The CSE O\&E Team will adjust summaries based on feedback, ask questions as needed, and resolve comments once the summary has been updated.  
  * Community Insights Corrections/Edits Process  
    * Community members who have contributed insights and wish to see a correction of their comments may request changes in comments.
