**Raw Notes**

*Moderator: The focus for the panel: How do we bring in good jobs into the region? How do we make this the community we’ve always wanted? We want to hear from nonprofits about the communities they serve. The moderator asked panelists to “switch hats” from nonprofit leaders to thinking about the communities and clients they serve in the region and to offer insights on the needs of the community and what is already working well.*

Music Changing Lives: 

* Barriers: We need to listen to youth and to provide wages for artists  
* Solutions: State of the Youth \- Listening Sessions region- and statewide to identify 3 top youth issues; youth select and champion one issue, develop policy brief and advocacy platform. Los Angeles County youth identified a need to identify for unhoused where to find resources and housing. Listening Sessions are effective and only require 5 hours of engagement per group. We need to partner with San Bernardino County Schools to bring this model into our region.

Arts Connection: 

* Barriers:   
  * Program design, strategies, and funding should include human-centered and community-centered design.   
  * Creative Corps was able to offer 53 state-funded grants, but 400 applicants did not receive funding. Funding for arts and culture is needed.  
* Solutions:   
  * Nonprofits center community’s experience, provide resources and tools to elevate and address issues the community is experiencing.   
  * Collaboration with other nonprofits is successful.  
  * Issue-centered program design: Creative Corps Inland SoCal is a statewide regranting model rolled out with other nonprofit partners with a funding framework that provided 53 arts and culture grants around 4 key issues, the environment, civic participation, social justice, and health. 80% of funding went directly to artists. Now artists are partnering, collaborating, building networks with local jurisdictions, local nonprofits, and community neighborhood associations, city councils to address community issues and needs.  
  * Nonprofits braid funding, resources, and tools to serve the community and put the community at the center of program design.

Sahaba Initiative

* Barriers:  
  * Listening sessions are needed for effective and cost effective solutions  
* Solutions:  
  * Listening sessions: During the Afghanistan refugee crisis, when planning for 800 refugees (housing, etc.), program designers realized that they needed to listen to what refugees needed. After one conversation with one person, we realized we needed to listen to what they needed. We set up Listening Sessions for the community to listen to needs. Superpower of nonprofits: nonprofits are in the community and from the community, so it’s easy to facilitate conversation to lead to results. Most helpful was to connect with sectors from back home to connect here. We were able to shorten time to get refugee families back on their feet. We were successful not because of funding; we were successful because we listened to the community’s needs. They (the community) know what they want. They know what they are passionate about. Nonprofits can facilitate and add that extra little push to get them there. This is so much more effective – so much more cost effective for everyone. And it leads to our community thriving.

Child Care Resource Center

* Barriers:  
  * We can’t bring good jobs to the region without childcare. It’s a must. If parents are working, we must have childcare. “Parents earning while children are learning.” Childcare at its core is education. We sometimes in our society hear childcare and think about babysitting. People don’t know that childcare providers are early child development specialists; they are educators.  
  * Parents need choice in type of childcare (small vs. large) and provider. Evening and weekend childcare is important. We need opportunities for middle income families in addition to low income.  
  * We have moved to a cost equality rate model, but the challenge to that is middle income families cannot afford to pay for childcare. “We have priced middle income families out of childcare.” For a family of 4 with 2 working parents and 2 kids under three, your childcare is about $4000 a month. We need support for middle income families, not just low income families. All families need childcare.  
  * We need private partnerships.  
  * If we are going to build a housing community, we need a childcare center and a family resource center that has the arts, homework help, and a computer center.  
  * Transportation is huge. Many of the families we’re serving have transportation issues. We need childcare available in the most remote areas, and we need to provide transportation to childcare. “Child care is a hub.”

Inland Empire Youth Collective

* Barriers:   
  * How do we help our youth stay, work, and thrive in the region?   
  * How do we get youth connected to actual jobs? We can have all the mentoring, training, apprenticeship, and fellowships, but there are no jobs waiting for skilled workers. We should be able to funnel workers into jobs.   
  * We see low-road staffing agencies serve logistics; we need that too.  
  * How do we keep talent here? We deserve to keep our community here.  
* Solutions:  
  * We are helping people create LLCs. We have mentoring, apprenticeships, and fellowship programs, and more ways to generate income.  
  * We see the opportunity to work with other folks – that interconnectedness. We can create a nonprofit collective. We would like to explore this with CERF funding.

Arts Connection

* Barriers:  
  * As a young professional, I want to stay here. I see the huge disparity in the jobs that are keeping our community struggling – and even sometimes suffering. How do we thrive? It’s important for us to think about what are the key drivers that are going to affect the economy now and into the future?  
  * If we don’t have the foresight, industries take advantage of us. In Bloomington,  rural areas now have Amazon warehouses. Because that industry had the foresight, and their voice is the loudest.  
  * How do we use nonprofits and the public sector to center community and think about the future, so we can have a strategy to ensure that our community is going to be thriving in the future.  
* Solutions:  
  * Model to consider from the state for thinking about economic landscape: STEEP (social, technological, economic, environment, policy/political) When we think about the future, we have to have foresight of the drivers. 

A Greater Hope

* Barriers:  
  * How does your city take care of itself and present itself? I love graffiti removal in SB, because I can call and graffiti is removed in 24 hours. We all need to do that. We need to present ourselves as best as we can. We can have great jobs here, but if it doesn’t look the place I want, I’m not going to stay. Let’s make it beautiful.

*Question from the moderator around public dollars and the value of public dollars. Nonprofits bring in public dollars into the region. Can you speak to the amount of public dollars and the workforce they bring in?*

Child Care Resource Center:

* Barriers:  
  * Legislators need to hear what nonprofits bring in and the bigger impact they have beyond programming.  
* Solutions:  
  * Subsidy dollars: Parents can pick the child care they want and we pay for families’ child care costs. We distribute approximately $530 million in SoCal just in child care alone, serving 40-50,000 working parents who earn over $1 billion in LA and SB county. So we earn $1.5 billion. All of this money is in the community and it stays here. These families don’t take vacations; they stay here. They are concerned about putting better food on the table, buying better clothes, maybe a little bigger house, or better neighborhood. They are concerned about things that are community-driven.   
  * The money invested in nonprofits. It’s huge what nonprofits put into the community. 

The Mom & Dad Project

* Barriers:   
  * Impact of nonprofit staff impact outside of nonprofit work  
* Solutions:  
  * Small 10-person staff. Not just measurable impact on economy  (we live here, we work here, we spend here, etc.), but staff is directly involved in community e.g. coaching kids, tutoring, volunteering, afterschool programs. Our team’s work does not stop outside our 4 walls. Our staff wants to better their community.

A Greater Hope

* Barriers:  
  * Children in our region have no voice  
  * Nonprofits provide that civic connection  
  * Transportation is a struggle. We can have the greatest places in our region, but if families can’t there, that’s a struggle.   
  * Industry sector training and education should start in school  
  * Many children are in survival mode and struggle to find their voice.   
  * Workforce development starts in middle school, but we need to start sooner. It’s hard to catch kids later.   
  * We need structured opportunities for learning about work.  
  * We need more preparation and discussion around careers, not just jobs.  
* Solutions:  
  * We offer opportunities to elevate children’s voices.  
  * Due to transportation issues, we are picking up kids and taking them places, because they cannot get around.   
  * Kids see our community as a place to stay and a place to support. Nonprofits help connect youth back into the community.

Music Changing Lives 

* Barriers:   
  * In our region, true collaboration is hard to find. How do we build true partnerships where ideas don’t get misappropriated? We need to uplift nonprofits that are really doing the work.   
  *   
* Solutions:  
  * Music Changing Lives helped start Arts Connection. Now there is an ED for that org. That is a success.  
  * We launched a hunger relief program that brought 8 million pounds of fresh produce through a CalFresh partnership – that’s $13 million in savings for families.  
  * Music Changing Lives has been serving the region for 26 years. Change takes time. It’s not easy. “Don’t crash your car to swat a fly.” Stay strong and stay true to your mission. Celebrate small wins as a nonprofit; accept that things take time. Have grit and keep trying.  
  * People in this room have helped our org write policy. That is the kind of collaboration we need.

Sahaba Initiative

* Barriers:  
  * When talking about public dollars, the goal is to best utilize those dollars. One sector often overlooked in funding is nonprofits. If our governments would support more nonprofits, we would see a more drastic and lasting change.  
* Solutions:   
  * Nonprofits do a lot with a little. Nonprofits get stuff done. However, many will say that if you want to have a good job, stay away from nonprofits, because of lack of funding. But nonprofits are effective with enough funding, and they lead our community to living meaningful lives and being passionate about what they do. Being able to have a job where they are serving their community and the community around them – that’s what nonprofits can do. With private partnership and public dollars, nonprofits can do a lot. Nonprofits can make things happen with $0 dollars in the bank and no staff. Nonprofit impact on the community is massive. 

Inland Empire Youth Collective

* Barriers:   
  * Public funds are difficult to access for nonprofits and community members, if you don’t have capacity. Some nonprofits are not used to writing grants, and it’s very intimidating, especially when working with undocumented individuals. Especially with workforce funding and federal funds accessing funds is difficult.   
  * We rely on grassroots funding and private funding. We need public funding.  
* Solutions:  
  * We are helping our youth who are graduating and entering the workforce – helping them to stay in the IE and continuing to work and serve their community.
