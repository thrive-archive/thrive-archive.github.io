**GSB SRT Meeting Summary \- 4/25/2024**

GSB SRT met to discuss the questions posed by UCR on 4/25/2024. The meeting had 10 participants and 3 SRT leads. Participants were divided into two groups and self-selected questions to discuss. Responses from both groups are summarized by the question below.

**Questions and Response Summaries:** 

**Question Set 1\.**  
Let’s assume workers in the GSB subregion were provided with all of the support (ex: paid training, additional education, childcare, etc.) needed to get a promising job of their choice this year.

1. **What difficulties or problems do you think might come up for workers in the GSB region over the next year in terms of keeping that job? What about over the next 5 years?**

*Participants noted the disabled community has a range of needs and requires ongoing support in the form of social skills development and counseling services to maintain their position at work. Employers and industries should be educated on the needs and job readiness of disabled workers. Disabled workers also experience diminishing social security benefits when employed.* 

*Childcare-related issues concerning high cost, availability, and routine changes create difficulties for employees. Implementation of childcare has issues as well with training and insurance barriers.*

*Workers face housing challenges when displaced due to rent increases. They may need to move farther away from a quality job to find affordable housing, causing time management and transportation issues.*

*The “region needs to build programs beyond just survival for residents,” the participants noted. Workers need life skills training on finances, literacy, and parenthood. General counseling for life skills or trauma could be beneficial as well. This could also come in the form of mid-career support and planning assistance, i.e. balancing changing priorities, budgeting, and management training/skills boosting.* 

*Workers need reliable transportation; voucher or bus programs don’t provide needed independence.* 

2. **What type of support do you think workers in the GSB subregion would need several years down the road to be able to move up (advance, get promoted) in that job?**

*The disabled community could use on-site job coaching and mentorship programs for life skills.*  
*Youth in the region need a long-term intentional and regular mentorship program that helps them apply for and get to jobs. Another proposed program would be an after-school work readiness program or apprenticeship for middle school and high school students.*   
*Participants generally indicated a need for financial literacy and career planning programs. Career planning programs could help with resume building, life skills, and career advancement. Participants also noted a need for child care and transportation access to remain and get promoted in their field. Specifically, there is a want for a centralized, climate-friendly transportation hub with a carpool program and childcare facilities.*

*Employers should support staff development and implement hiring practices that require city and county employees to live in the area they serve. In addition, employers should offer good benefits which include childcare support, and invest in upskilling their workforce.* 

*The aviation industry was mentioned to be in need of pilots, which could become a career pathway for residents.*

3. **What organizations, programs, or initiatives are currently supporting workers in the GSB subregion in getting and keeping a promising job?**

**Question Set 2\.**  
Let’s assume workers in the GSB subregion were provided with all of the support (ex: a small business loan, other financial resources, legal advice, etc.) needed to start their own business this year.

1. **What difficulties or problems do you think might come up for workers in the GSB sub-region over the next year in terms of keeping that business in good shape? What about over the next 5 years?**  
   

*Small businesses experience barriers such as a lack of legal support or representation, marketing skills, retirement planning and security, and knowledge of business jargon. Spanish-speaking individuals, women, and people of color need support getting into commercial real estate.*

2. **What type of support do you think workers in the GSB subregion would need several years down the road to be able to grow that business?**  
   

*Participants propose a regional resource hub, best practice guide, small business ordinance workshops, and a variety of different programs targeting different needs and groups. Participants indicate real estate as a promising career pathway.*

* *Insurance sales mentoring program*  
* *Pilot small business support worker program*
