<h1>Coachella/Morongo Basin SRT Meeting Summary</h1>

<p><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>March 29, 2024</span></p>

<h2><strong><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>OVERVIEW:</span></strong></h2>

<p><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>The Coachella/Morongo Basin
SRT Meeting on March 29th consisted of 6 attendees and 3 SRT leads. The
attendees came from various locations including Coachella, Riverside, Beaumont,
Spring Valley, Palm Springs, Anaheim, San Bernardino, and Yucca Valley. Both
attendees and SRT leads represented different affinity groups; 2 from labor, 2
elected officials, 1 non-profit, and 4 business owners. Approximately 6
Community Insights Surveys were completed and it was requested that SRT send
out surveys to email with the new due date. It was recommended for the next
meeting or via email to identify specific orgs, programs, or collaborations in
the region. This summary describes themes identified in meeting notes/a
transcript of the meeting recording.</span></p>

<h2><strong><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>DISCUSSION:</span></strong></h2>

<p><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>The meeting participants
discussed case study and solutions-oriented with ideas around best practices.
Primarily covering Transportation, Career Pathways, Skills Building, Housing,
and Industries.</span></p>

<h2><strong><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>THEMES:</span></strong></h2>

<p><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>5 major themes emerged from
this meeting. For 4 of them - Transportation, Career Pathways, Housing, and
Skills Building - both barriers and solutions were presented related to these
topics. The Industries theme was presented as opportunities for training and
development within the following key industries: Energy, GIS Technology,
Robotics, Energy Efficient Vehicles, and Construction.</span></p>

<h3><strong><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Transportation</span></strong></h3>

<p><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>A few key barriers emerged
for this theme including a lack of a reliable public transportation system, the
feasibility of energy efficient vehicles, and traffic. The mentions for public
transportation highlight insufficient transit, especially in the evening hours.
Energy efficient vehicles like EVs and Hydrogen also present a range of issues
including their affordability, �EVs [are] too expensive all around,� and
insufficient infrastructure causing �range anxiety� among their users as there
are limited charging locations: �Stations don�t work and take too long to be
repaired.� Issues related to traffic mention delays due to 62 highway being the
primary access road.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>The solutions proposed for
the Transportation theme include the need to �wrap jobs and services around
transit�, expanding mass transit systems like �more bus and train lines and
high speed rail from Redlands, through Beaumont, to the desert�, increasing
infrastructure for energy efficient vehicles like �EV charging stations and
training�, and innovating to improve traffic management like �building a
logistics corridor�, �developing transit agency for desert transportation
infrastructure�, increasing the number of �self-driving vehicles�, and creating
a platform to �harness data to move traffic more efficiently� as per the
�Michael Lim case study.�</span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>The solution to building
transit-oriented communities to wrap jobs around mass transit also mentions a
focus on designing communities �around train stops for Bright Line� and other
lines and creates a �smooth transportation shift from train to next mode�
especially for disabled people. Other concerns include the future Coachella
Valley rail line that �has been approved but is 20 years out� and �currently
determining the stops; Bright Line from Las Vegas to Rancho Cucamonga� and the
need to collaborate �with SCAG, transit agencies, cities, and community to plan
for transit stops in order to improve �experiences at train stops�. The mention
also includes a focus on advocating for a publicity campaign to educate the
general public about train culture and the benefit of being able to integrate
�nature, food, culture, pleasure trips, child care, grocery stores, afterschool
programs, training program, arts, community/social&nbsp; hubs around train
stops�, taking into account the �Singapore model�. Another mention that merges
two themes; Transportation and Housing, highlights the importance of �reducing
low density, single family housing� in favor of �higher density housing near
transit�. The case study referenced is �Cul-de-sac Tempe, AZ - pre-fab
buildings�.&nbsp; This shows the need for urban planning to strategically
integrate transportation, housing, and employment hubs for improving quality of
life in communities.</span></p>

<h3><strong><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Career Pathways</span></strong></h3>

<p><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Several barriers emerge for
this theme including the gap between the skills acquired through education and
industry demands, lack of STEM education in early schooling, challenges of
parents in supporting their children with school assignments, as �Parents don�t
have access or training to teach tech�, inadequate pathways to place skilled
workers into jobs, for example, �200 semi-trained in cybersecurity on waiting
list but no jobs available, reveals there is limited mentoring opportunities to
help transition graduates into the workforce. One of the most prevalent
concerns revolves around �schools not preparing workforce with adequate
skills�, and sometimes there is a disconnect between skills learned in �schools
and real world use�. In the technology sector, college graduates lack the
training needed for their jobs, revealing a need for in-job training, some
examples include, �coders out of school can�t code until the employer pays to
train for 6 months�, and �college-trained employee took 8 months for employer
to train in project management�.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>The solutions proposed for
the Career Pathways theme include innovation in education practices, expanding
apprenticeships, mentorship programs, and �Third spaces�, as well as developing
models for �private/public partnerships'' in which �government can support but
should not lead�. When it comes to innovating education practices there is a
need for �smaller satellite trade schools� and �project-based learning
schools�, and a balance between theory and �experiential learning� so students
get �real world training�. For example, �Don�t teach HTML in Computer Science;
teach for innovation�. There was a mention for apprenticeships to allow
�students to work on site with tech and business� to �make clear connections
between learning and jobs through project work�. For example, �Cybersecurity
businesses �don�t care� about education but want to see 203 great projects�,
emphasizing the need for candidates to have ample practical experience rather
than degrees or certificates in order to find a job. It was also mentioned the
need to �develop networks to create projects� and a �centralized hub of info,
networks, and resource for the region�. For mentorship programs the focus was
on �starting in elementary school and within the school system�, emphasizing
the importance for mentors to �look like community, especially in BIPOC
communities� as this would create trust and better �encourage youth to
transform lives�. For �Third space�, it was mentioned to create �co-work space
and shared spaces, and incubator spaces/hubs� to �banish loneliness, catalyze
networks and innovation� and support the community with �social
entrepreneurship� as per the �Municipalized We Work� case study.</span></p>

<h3><strong><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Housing</span></strong></h3>

<p><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Two barriers emerged for this
theme including insufficient low income housing stock, and low housing density
near transit systems. The solutions proposed were an increase of workforce
housing, a reduction of low density housing, and a change in policy recommending
�30% public housing�. Although these barriers fall within the housing theme, it
is evident that this problem is related to transportation access in the region;
having limited housing options near their places of work, workers have
challenging commutes.</span></p>

<h3><strong><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Skills Building</span></strong></h3>

<p><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>For this theme, the barriers
that emerged were inefficient communication among workers and employers
reflecting the observation that �Regionally people are �working in silos�,
there is competition and a scarcity mindset�, and a lack of training and apprenticeship
programs for disinvested communities especially for women who �need trades
support�,&nbsp; and for folks in the desert area as it is too far and there is
�insufficient access to training�.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>The solutions proposed for
the Skills Building theme mention the �need for satellite training hubs�,
�small business and entrepreneurship� that �support community building, equity,
and social entrepreneurship and fosters creativity and grit. It is also proposed
to �develop and build on trades �sisterhood� for women�, and �leadership and
DEI training for kids� with a focus on �culture, innovation, teaching
resilience, learning to adapt� as seen in the �One OC� case study. There is a
mention for �DEI to mean finding diverse groups of youth/diamonds in the rough
early on and offering opportunities�. Some questions that were asked to foster
this conversation are:</span></p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Symbol'>�<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>How can we build
on diverse backgrounds/diverse experiences?</span></p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Symbol'>�<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>What dream, future
jobs can we expose diverse youth to early on to create access?</span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Another mention said
�electrical trades training and structure is an apprenticement model for
management� and expects to include �skills building, apprenticeships, on the
job training, and mentorship� to �close knowledge gaps�. Some examples include:</span></p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Symbol'>�<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Electrical trades
mentorship and skills building is built into the network structure</span></p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Symbol'>�<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Case study: Pilot
program: High school after-school pre-apprenticeship program</span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Another solution proposed
community-centric programs to �build trust, wrap workers in mentoring,
apprenticeships, and self-sustaining models that support workers through
retirement� and provide �network building and community building� as those were
identified as keys to a �successful model�.</span></p>

<h3><strong><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Industries</span></strong></h3>

<p><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>The energy sector needs
�proactive planning and public transit infrastructure for the lithium
industry.� There's also a need for energy-efficient jobs and training a skilled
labor market for a transition to hydrogen energy. Education on green energy is
essential, emphasizing diverse solutions like gantry lines and hydrogen. In GIS
technology, there's a �need for improved geospatial awareness� and
user-friendly training in this technology. Robotics demand a shift from fear
about �robots taking jobs� to education for humans to �program, maintain, and
run� robots, focusing on innovation and making repetitive labor more efficient.
For the Energy Efficient Vehicles industry, there is opportunity in
�manufacturing and training�. In construction, training in �prefab
manufacturing� and �green building� are mentioned as possible opportunities for
this sector, alongside building �workforce housing� and �high density housing
and transit hubs with incubators and satellite training hubs�. Once again,
there is a call for strategic integration of housing and transit hubs with
centers for training and/or employment.</span></p>
