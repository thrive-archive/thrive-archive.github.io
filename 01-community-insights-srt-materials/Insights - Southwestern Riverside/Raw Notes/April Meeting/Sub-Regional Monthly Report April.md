| Summary of Activities: |
| :---- |
| We hosted our SRT meeting on April 16th at the TVE2 location. Participation was primarily on Zoom and we had approximately a total of 32 people in attendance. We also attended the Menifee Community Partners meeting on April 9th where we shared about the SRT meeting and the survey. After our SRT meeting on the 16th, we sent out the reviewer packet to those who signed up to be a reviewers.  During the meeting, the group discussed many of the sections of the packet. One topic that was discussed in some detail was the employer-sponsored housing. The group felt that while it would be nice to have employers sponsor housing, it would only be the very largest employers who would have the capacity to do so. Most people, particularly in the Inland Empire, work for small to mid-size organizations that would not be able to provide employer-sponsored housing.  When discussing the question prompts that were provided around keeping a good job some of the barriers or issues that were raised were changes in the economy, technology advancements making positions obsolete, lack of reliable transportation, and availability of affordable housing. The types of support that would help an individual move up would be: tuition reimbursement, more school options in the area, and mentorship. For the business-focused question, the barriers included rising employment costs, regulations, costs of development, available real estate, supply and material costs, inflation, cyber security issues, and costs of marketing.  Support that would assist this business includes: access to capital, real estate available for expansion, employment retention/availability, human resources support, and keeping up with security. There were two issues that were discussed that we felt would be more impactful to helping people access and keep jobs if addressed. Those include helping those who have been involved with the justice system and helping those dealing with addiction issues. Workforce participation rates are at all-time lows due in part to the high rates of those dealing with addiction.   |
| **News Media Mentions:** |
| The SRT meeting has been shared on multiple social media channels including the EDC’s and local chambers.   |
| **Lessons Learned:** |
| It was good to bring out issues like former incarceration and addiction issues as barriers, as those had not been previously discussed. Due to some collaboration challenges (listed below), we are going to work on changing the format to make they hybrid meeting more engaging.   |
| **Collaborative Challenges:** |
| While having the meeting in a hybrid format allows for greater accessibility, it is challenging when trying to garner equal participation, particularly when we are working on reviewing documents, trying to have conversations between in-person and online groups is very challenging to have very in-depth conversation.  |
| **Participation:** |
| Please keep a detailed account of participants and stakeholders that attend events (virtual and in person) and receive gift cards. These details will include the subject’s first name, last name, email address, and phone number, if available. However, if the participant receiving the gift card is a minor, only the first name and last name will be mandatory.- Participant List is in the google drive.  |
